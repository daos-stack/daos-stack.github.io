    <h1 id="system-administration">System Administration</h1>
<h2 id="system-monitoring">System Monitoring</h2>
<p>System monitoring and telemetry data will be provided as part of the
control plane and will be documented in a future revision.</p>
<h2 id="system-operations">System Operations</h2>
<h3 id="full-shutdown-and-restart">Full Shutdown and Restart</h3>
<p>Details on how to support proper DAOS server shutdown will be provided
in a future revision.</p>
<h3 id="fault-domain-maintenance-and-reintegration">Fault Domain Maintenance and Reintegration</h3>
<p>Details on how to drain an individual storage node or fault domain (e.g.
rack) in preparation for maintenance activity and how to reintegrate it
will be provided in a future revision.</p>
<h3 id="daos-system-extension">DAOS System Extension</h3>
<p>Ability to add new DAOS server instances to a pre-existing DAOS system
will be documented in a future revision.</p>
<h2 id="fault-management">Fault Management</h2>
<p>DAOS relies on massively distributed single-ported storage. Each target
is thus effectively a single point of failure. DAOS achieves
availability and durability of both data and metadata by providing
redundancy across targets in different fault domains.</p>
<h3 id="fault-detection-isolation">Fault Detection &amp; Isolation</h3>
<p>DAOS servers are monitored within a DAOS system through a gossip-based
protocol called SWIM<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028914">^1</a> that provides accurate, efficient, and scalable
server fault detection.</p>
<p>Storage attached to each DAOS target is monitored through periodic local
health assessment. Whenever a local storage I/O error is returned to the
DAOS server, an internal health check procedure will be called
automatically. This procedure makes an overall health assessment by
analyzing the IO error code and device SMART/Health data. If the result
is negative, the target will be marked as faulty, and further I/Os to
this target will be rejected and re-routed.</p>
<p>Once detected, the faulty target or servers (effectively a set of
targets) must be excluded from each pool membership. This process is
triggered either manually by the administrator or automatically (see
next section for more information). Upon exclusion from the pool map,
each target starts the collective rebuild process automatically to
restore data redundancy. The rebuild process is designed to operate
online while servers continue to process incoming I/O operations from
applications.</p>
<p>Tools to monitor and manage rebuild are still under development.</p>
<h3 id="rebuild-throttling">Rebuild Throttling</h3>
<p>The rebuild process may consume many resources on each server and
can be throttled to reduce the impact on application performance. This
current logic relies on CPU cycles on the storage nodes. By default, the
rebuild process is configured to consume up to 30% of the CPU cycles,
leaving the other 70% for regular I/O operations.</p>
<p>During the rebuild process, the user can set the throttle to guarantee the
rebuild will not use more resource than the user setting. The user can
only set the CPU cycle for now. For example, if the user set the
throttle to 50, then the rebuild will at most use 50% of the CPU cycle to do
the rebuild job. The default rebuild throttle for CPU cycle is 30. This
parameter can be changed via the daos_mgmt_set_params() API call and
will be eventually available through the management tools.</p>
<h2 id="software-upgrade">Software Upgrade</h2>
<p>Interoperability in DAOS is handled via protocol and schema versioning
for persistent data structures. Further instructions on how to manage
DAOS software upgrades will be provided in a future revision.</p>
<h3 id="protocol-interoperability">Protocol Interoperability</h3>
<p>Limited protocol interoperability is provided by the DAOS storage stack.
Version compatibility checks will be performed to verify that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All targets in the same pool run the same protocol version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client libraries linked with the application may be up to one
    protocol version older than the targets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If a protocol version mismatch is detected among storage targets in the
same pool, the entire DAOS system will fail to start up and will report
failure to the control API. Similarly, the connection from clients
running a protocol version incompatible with the targets will return an
error.</p>
<h3 id="persistent-schema-compatibility-and-update">Persistent Schema Compatibility and Update</h3>
<p>The schema of persistent data structures may evolve from time to time to
fix bugs, add new optimizations, or support new features. To that end,
the persistent data structures support schema versioning.</p>
<p>Upgrading the schema version will not be performed automatically and
must be initiated by the administrator. A dedicated upgrade tool will be
provided to upgrade the schema version to the latest one. All targets in
the same pool must have the same schema version. Version checks are
performed at system initialization time to enforce this constraint.</p>
<p>To limit the validation matrix, each new DAOS release will be published
with a list of supported schema versions. To run with the new DAOS
release, administrators will then need to upgrade the DAOS system to one
of the supported schema versions. New pool shards will always be
formatted with the latest version. This versioning schema only applies
to a data structure stored in persistent memory and not to block storage
that only stores user data with no metadata.</p>
<h2 id="storage-scrubbing">Storage Scrubbing</h2>
<p>Support for end-to-end data integrity is planned for DAOS v1.2 and
background checksum scrubbing for v2.2. Once available, that
functionality will be documented here.</p>
