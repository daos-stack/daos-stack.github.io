    <h1 id="hardware-requirements">Hardware Requirements</h1>
<p>The purpose of this section is to describe processor, storage, and
network requirements to deploy a DAOS system.</p>
<h2 id="deployment-options">Deployment Options</h2>
<p>As illustrated in the figure below, a DAOS system can be deployed in two
different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pooled Storage Model</strong>: The DAOS servers can run on dedicated
    storage nodes in separate racks. This is a traditional pool model
    where storage is uniformly accessed by all compute nodes. In order
    to minimize the number of I/O racks and to optimize floor space,
    this approach usually requires high-density storage servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disaggregated Storage Model</strong>: In the disaggregated model, the
    storage nodes are integrated into compute racks and can be either
    dedicated or shared (e.g., in a hyper-converged infrastructure)
    nodes. The DAOS servers are thus massively distributed and storage
    access is non-uniform and must take locality into account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While DAOS is mostly deployed following the pooled model, active
research is conducted to efficiently support the disaggregated model as
well.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/image1.png" /></p>
<h2 id="processor-requirements">Processor Requirements</h2>
<p>DAOS requires a 64-bit processor architecture and is primarily developed
on Intel 64 architecture. The DAOS software and the libraries it depends
on (e.g., ISA-L, SPDK, PMDK, and DPDK) can take advantage of Intel® SSE
and AVX extensions.</p>
<p>DAOS is also regularly tested on 64-bit ARM processors configured in
Little Endian mode. The same build instructions that are used for x86-64
are applicable for ARM builds as well. DAOS and its dependencies will
make the necessary adjustments automatically in their respective build
systems for ARM platforms.</p>
<h2 id="network-requirements">Network Requirements</h2>
<p>The DAOS network layer relies on libfabrics and supports OFI providers
for Ethernet/sockets, InfiniBand/verbs, RoCE, Cray’s GNI, and the Intel
Omni-Path Architecture. An RDMA-capable fabric is preferred for better
performance. DAOS can support multiple rails by binding different
instances of the DAOS server to individual network cards.</p>
<p>An additional out-of-band network connecting the nodes in the DAOS
service cluster is required for DAOS administration. Management traffic
uses IP over Fabric.</p>
<h2 id="storage-requirements">Storage Requirements</h2>
<p>DAOS requires each storage node to have direct access to storage-class
memory (SCM). While DAOS is primarily tested and tuned for Optane DC
Persistent Memory, the DAOS software stack is built over the Persistent
Memory Development Kit (PMDK) and the DAX feature of the Linux and
Windows operating systems as described in the SNIA NVM Programming
Model<a href="https://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/technical_work/final/NVMProgrammingModel_v1.2.pdf">^1</a>. As a result, the open-source DAOS software stack should be
able to run transparently over any storage-class memory
supported by PMDK.</p>
<p>The storage node can be optionally equipped with NVMe (non-volatile
memory express) SSDs to provide capacity. HDDs, as well as SATA and SAS
SSDs, are not supported by DAOS. Both NVMe 3D-NAND and Optane SSDs are
supported. Optane SSDs are preferred for DAOS installation that targets
a very high IOPS rate. NVMe-oF devices are also supported by the
userspace storage stack, but have never been tested.</p>
<p>The minimal recommended ratio between SCM and SSDs capacity is 6% to
guarantee that DAOS has enough space in SCM to store internal metadata
(e.g., pool metadata, SSD block allocation tracking).</p>
<p>For testing purposes, SCM can be emulated with DRAM by mounting a tmpfs
filesystem, and NVMe SSDs can be also emulated with DRAM or a loopback
file.</p>
<h2 id="cpu-affinity">CPU Affinity</h2>
<p>On recent Xeon platforms, PCIe slots have a natural affinity to one CPU.
Although globally accessible from any of the system cores, NVMe SSDs and
network interface cards connected through the PCIe bus may provide
different performance characteristics (e.g., higher latency, lower
bandwidth) to each CPU. Accessing “remote” PCIe devices may involve
traffic over the UPI (Ultra Path Interconnect) link that might become a
point of congestion. Similarly, persistent memory is non-uniformly
accessible (NUMA), and CPU affinity must be respected for maximal
performance.</p>
<p>Therefore, when running in a multi-socket and multi-rail environment,
the DAOS service must be able to detect the CPU to PCIe device and
persistent memory affinity and minimize as much as possible non-local
access. This can be achieved by spawning one instance of the I/O server
per CPU, then accessing only local persistent memory and PCI devices
from that server instance. The control plane is responsible for
detecting the storage and network affinity and starting the I/O servers
accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="fault-domains">Fault Domains</h2>
<p>DAOS relies on single-ported storage massively distributed across
different storage nodes. Each storage node is thus a single point of
failure. DAOS achieves fault tolerance by providing data redundancy
across storage nodes in different fault domains.</p>
<p>DAOS assumes that fault domains are hierarchical and do not overlap. For
instance, the first level of a fault domain could be the racks and the
second one the storage nodes.</p>
<p>For efficient placement and optimal data resilience, more fault
domains are better. As a result, it is preferable to distribute storage
nodes across as many racks as possible.</p>
