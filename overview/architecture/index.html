    <h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>
<p>DAOS is an open-source software-defined scale-out object store that provides
high bandwidth and high IOPS storage containers to applications and enables
next-generation data-centric workflows combining simulation, data analytics,
and machine learning.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional storage stacks that were primarily designed for
rotating media, DAOS is architected from the ground up to exploit new
NVM technologies and is extremely lightweight since it operates
End-to-End (E2E) in user space with full OS bypass. DAOS offers a shift
away from an I/O model designed for block-based and high-latency storage
to one that inherently supports fine-grained data access and unlocks the
performance of the next-generation storage technologies.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional Burst Buffers, DAOS is a high-performant independent
and fault-tolerant storage tier that does not rely on a third-party tier
to manage metadata and data resilience.</p>
<h2 id="daos-features">DAOS Features</h2>
<p>DAOS relies on OFI for low-latency communications and stores data on
both storage-class memory and NVMe storage. DAOS presents a native
key-array-value storage interface that offers a unified storage model
over which domain-specific data models are ported, such as HDF5, MPI-IO,
and Apache Arrow. A POSIX I/O emulation layer implementing files and
directories over the native DAOS API is also available.</p>
<p>DAOS I/O operations are logged and then inserted into a persistent index
maintained in SCM. Each I/O is tagged with a particular timestamp called
epoch and is associated with a particular version of the dataset. No
read-modify-write operations are performed internally. Write operations
are non-destructive and not sensitive to alignment. Upon read request,
the DAOS service walks through the persistent index and creates a
complex scatter-gather Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) descriptor to
reconstruct the data at the requested version directly in the buffer
provided by the application.</p>
<p>The SCM storage is memory-mapped directly into the address space of the
DAOS service that manages the persistent index via direct load/store.
Depending on the I/O characteristics, the DAOS service can decide to
store the I/O in either SCM or NVMe storage. As represented in Figure
2-1, latency-sensitive I/Os, like application metadata and byte-granular
data, will typically be stored in the former, whereas checkpoints and
bulk data will be stored in the latter. This approach allows DAOS to
deliver the raw NVMe bandwidth for bulk data by streaming the data to
NVMe storage and maintaining internal metadata index in SCM. The
Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK)[^1] allows managing
transactional access to SCM and the Storage Performance Development Kit
(SPDK)[^2] enables user-space I/O to NVMe devices.</p>

<h2 id="daos-components">DAOS Components</h2>
<p>A data center may have hundreds of thousands of compute nodes
interconnected via a scalable high-performance fabric, where all, or a
subset of the nodes called storage nodes, have direct access to NVM
storage. A DAOS installation involves several components that can be
either collocated or distributed.</p>
<h3 id="daos-target-server-and-system">DAOS Target, Server and System</h3>
<p>The DAOS server is a multi-tenant daemon running on a Linux instance
(i.e. natively on the physical node or in a VM or container) of each
storage node and exporting through the network the locally-attached NVM
storage. It listens to a management port, addressed by an IP address and
a TCP port number, plus one or more fabric endpoints, addressed by
network URIs. The DAOS server is configured through a YAML file and can
be integrated with different daemon management or orchestration
frameworks (e.g., a systemd script, a Kubernetes service or even via a
parallel launcher like pdsh or srun).</p>
<p>A DAOS system is identified by a system name and consists of a set of
DAOS servers connected to the same fabric. Membership of the DAOS
servers is recorded into the system map that assigns a unique integer
rank to each server. Two different systems comprise two disjoint sets of
servers and do not coordinate with each other.</p>
<p>Inside a DAOS server, the storage is statically partitioned across
multiple targets to optimize concurrency. To avoid contention, each
target has its private storage, own pool of service threads and
dedicated network context that can be directly addressed over the fabric
independently of the other targets hosted on the same storage node. A
target is typically associated with a single-ported SCM module and NVMe
SSD attached to a single storage node. Moreover, a target does not
implement any internal data protection mechanism against storage media
failure. As a result, a target is a single point of failure. A dynamic
state is associated with each target and is set to either up and
running, or down and not available.</p>
<p>A target is the unit of performance. Hardware components associated with
the target, such as the backend storage medium, the server, and the
network, have limited capability and capacity.</p>
<p>The number of targets exported by a DAOS server instance is configurable
and depends on the underlying hardware (i.e., the number of SCM modules,
CPUs, NVMe SSDs ...). A target is the unit of fault.</p>
<h3 id="storage-api-application-interface-and-tools">Storage API, Application Interface and Tools</h3>
<p>Applications, users, and administrators can interact with a DAOS system
through two different client APIs. The management API offers the ability
to administrate a DAOS system. It is intended to be integrated with
different vendor-specific storage management or open-source
orchestration frameworks. A CLI tool is built over the DAOS management
API. On the other hand, the DAOS library (i.e., libdaos) implements the
DAOS storage model and is primarily targeted at application and I/O
middleware developers who want to store datasets in a DAOS system. User
utilities are also built over the API to allow users to manage datasets
from a CLI.</p>
<p>Applications can access datasets stored in DAOS either directly through
the native DAOS API or an I/O middleware libraries (e.g. POSIX
emulation, MPI-IO, HDF5) or frameworks (e.g., Spark, TensorFlow) already
integrated with the native DAOS storage model.</p>
<h3 id="agent">Agent</h3>
<p>The DAOS agent is a daemon residing on the client node that interacts
with the DAOS library to authenticate the application process. It is a
trusted entity that can sign the DAOS Client credentials using
certificates. The agent can support different authentication frameworks
and uses a Unix Domain Socket to communicate with the client library.</p>
