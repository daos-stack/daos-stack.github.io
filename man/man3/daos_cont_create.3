.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR daos_cont_create ()
creates an object address space known as a container.  Containers exist within
a pool.  The caller supplied
.I poh
parameter identifes the pool within which the container will be created.  The
.I uuid
parameter is the identifier of the container created by the call.  If the
create operation fails the contents of this variable are undefined.  The
.I ev
parameter determines whether the call is synchronous or asynchronous.  If the
caller supplies NULL, the call will block until complete.  If an event
structure is supplied the call will return immediately and the event is
used to track the completion status.

.BR daos_cont_create ()
returns zero on success or an error number upon error.
