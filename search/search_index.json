The DAOS Control Server instance acting as access point records DAOS I/O Server instances that join the system in a \"membership\". When up and running, the entire system (all I/O Server instances) can be shut down with the command: dmg -l <access_point_addr> system stop , after which DAOS Control Servers will continue to operate and listen on the management network. To start the system again (with no configuration changes) after a controlled shutdown, run the command dmg -l <access_point_addr> system start , DAOS I/O Servers managed by DAOS Control Servers will be started. To query the system membership, run the command dmg -l <access_point_addr> system query , this lists details (rank/uuid/control address/state) of DAOS I/O Servers in the system membership. Warning Controlled start/stop has some known limitations. \"start\" restarts all configured instances on all harnesses that can be located in the system membership, regardless of member state. Moreover, supplying the list of ranks to \"start\" and \"stop\" is not yet supported Fresh Start \u00b6 To reset the DAOS metadata across all hosts, the system must be reformatted. First, ensure all daos_server processes on all hosts have been stopped, then for each SCM mount specified in the config file ( scm_mount in the servers section) umount and wipe FS signatures. Example illustration with two IO instances specified in the config file: clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] umount /mnt/daos1 clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] umount /mnt/daos0 clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] wipefs -a /dev/pmem1 clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] wipefs -a /dev/pmem0 Then restart DAOS Servers and format. Fault Domain Maintenance and Reintegration \u00b6 Details on how to drain an individual storage node or fault domain (e.g. rack) in preparation for maintenance activity and how to reintegrate it will be provided in a future revision. DAOS System Extension \u00b6 Ability to add new DAOS server instances to a pre-existing DAOS system will be documented in a future revision. Fault Management \u00b6 DAOS relies on massively distributed single-ported storage. Each target is thus effectively a single point of failure. DAOS achieves availability and durability of both data and metadata by providing redundancy across targets in different fault domains. Fault Detection & Isolation \u00b6 DAOS servers are monitored within a DAOS system through a gossip-based protocol called SWIM 1 that provides accurate, efficient, and scalable server fault detection. Storage attached to each DAOS target is monitored through periodic local health assessment. Whenever a local storage I/O error is returned to the DAOS server, an internal health check procedure will be called automatically. This procedure makes an overall health assessment by analyzing the IO error code and device SMART/Health data. If the result is negative, the target will be marked as faulty, and further I/Os to this target will be rejected and re-routed. Once detected, the faulty target or servers (effectively a set of targets) must be excluded from each pool membership. This process is triggered either manually by the administrator or automatically (see the next section for more information). Upon exclusion from the pool map, each target starts the collective rebuild process automatically to restore data redundancy. The rebuild process is designed to operate online while servers continue to process incoming I/O operations from applications. Tools to monitor and manage rebuild are still under development. Rebuild Throttling \u00b6 The rebuild process may consume many resources on each server and can be throttled to reduce the impact on application performance. This current logic relies on CPU cycles on the storage nodes. By default, the rebuild process is configured to consume up to 30% of the CPU cycles, leaving the other 70% for regular I/O operations. During the rebuild process, the user can set the throttle to guarantee that the rebuild will not use more resources than the user setting. The user can only set the CPU cycle for now. For example, if the user set the throttle to 50, then the rebuild will at most use 50% of the CPU cycle to do the rebuild job. The default rebuild throttle for CPU cycle is 30. This parameter can be changed via the daos_mgmt_set_params() API call and will be eventually available through the management tools. Software Upgrade \u00b6 Interoperability in DAOS is handled via protocol and schema versioning for persistent data structures. Further instructions on how to manage DAOS software upgrades will be provided in a future revision. Protocol Interoperability \u00b6 Limited protocol interoperability is provided by the DAOS storage stack. Version compatibility checks will be performed to verify that: All targets in the same pool run the same protocol version. Client libraries linked with the application may be up to one protocol version older than the targets. If a protocol version mismatch is detected among storage targets in the same pool, the entire DAOS system will fail to start up and will report failure to the control API. Similarly, the connection from clients running a protocol version incompatible with the targets will return an error. Persistent Schema Compatibility and Update \u00b6 The schema of persistent data structures may evolve from time to time to fix bugs, add new optimizations, or support new features. To that end, the persistent data structures support schema versioning. Upgrading the schema version will not be performed automatically and must be initiated by the administrator. A dedicated upgrade tool will be provided to upgrade the schema version to the latest one. All targets in the same pool must have the same schema version. Version checks are performed at system initialization time to enforce this constraint. To limit the validation matrix, each new DAOS release will be published with a list of supported schema versions. To run with the new DAOS release, administrators will then need to upgrade the DAOS system to one of the supported schema versions. New pool shards will always be formatted with the latest version. This versioning schema only applies to a data structure stored in persistent memory and not to block storage that only stores user data with no metadata. Storage Scrubbing \u00b6 Support for end-to-end data integrity is planned for DAOS v1.2 and background checksum scrubbing for v2.2.

This procedure makes an overall health assessment by analyzing the IO error code and device SMART/Health data. If the result is negative, the target will be marked as faulty, and further I/Os to this target will be rejected and re-routed. Once detected, the faulty target or servers (effectively a set of targets) must be excluded from each pool membership.

Security is guaranteed via the use of certificates. The first type of commands run after installation include network and storage hardware provisioning and would typically be run from a login node. After daos_server instances have been started on each storage node for the first time, dmg storage prepare will set DCPM storage into the necessary state for use with DAOS. Then dmg storage format formats persistent storage devices (specified in the server configuration file) on the storage nodes and writes necessary metadata before starting DAOS I/O processes that will operate across the fabric. To sum up, the typical workflow of a DAOS system deployment consists of the following steps: Configure and start the DAOS server . Provision Hardware on all the storage nodes via the dmg utility. Format the DAOS system Set up and start the agent on the client nodes Validate that the DAOS system is operational Note that starting the DAOS server instances can be performed automatically on boot if start-up scripts are registered with systemd. The following subsections will cover each step in more detail. Before getting started, please make sure to review and complete the pre-flight checklist below. Preflight Checklist \u00b6 This section covers the preliminary setup required on the compute and storage nodes before deploying DAOS. Enable IOMMU (Optional) \u00b6 In order to run DAOS server as a non-root user with NVMe devices, the hardware must support virtualized device access, and it must be enabled in the system BIOS. On Intel\u00ae systems, this capability is named Intel\u00ae Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d). Once enabled in BIOS, IOMMU support must also be enabled in the Linux kernel. Exact details depend on the distribution, but the following example should be illustrative: # Enable IOMMU on CentOS 7 # All commands must be run as root/sudo! $ sudo vi /etc/default/grub # add the following line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"intel_iommu=on\" # after saving the file, run the following to reconfigure # the bootloader: $ sudo grub2-mkconfig --output=/boot/grub2/grub.cfg # if the command completed with no errors, reboot the system # in order to make the changes take effect $ sudo reboot Time Synchronization \u00b6 The DAOS transaction model relies on timestamps and requires time to be synchronized across all the storage and client nodes. This can be done using NTP or any other equivalent protocol. Runtime Directory Setup \u00b6 DAOS uses a series of Unix Domain Sockets to communicate between its various components. On modern Linux systems, Unix Domain Sockets are typically stored under /run or /var/run (usually a symlink to /run) and are a mounted tmpfs file system. There are several methods for ensuring the necessary directories are setup. A sign that this step may have been missed is when starting daos_server or daos_agent, you may see the message: $ mkdir /var/run/daos_server: permission denied Unable to create socket directory: /var/run/daos_server Non-default Directory \u00b6 By default, daos_server and daos_agent will use the directories /var/run/daos_server and /var/run/daos_agent respectively. To change the default location that daos_server uses for its runtime directory, either uncomment and set the socket_dir configuration value in install/etc/daos_server.yml, or pass the location to daos_server on the command line using the -d flag. For the daos_agent, an alternate location can be passed on the command line using the --runtime_dir flag. Default Directory (non-persistent) \u00b6 Files and directories created in /run and /var/run only survive until the next reboot. However, if reboots are infrequent, an easy solution while still utilizing the default locations is to create the required directories manually. To do this execute the following commands. daos_server: $ mkdir /var/run/daos_server $ chmod 0755 /var/run/daos_server $ chown user:user /var/run/daos_server (where user is the user you will run daos_server as) daos_agent: $ mkdir /var/run/daos_agent $ chmod 0755 /var/run/daos_agent $ chown user:user /var/run/daos_agent (where user is the user you will run daos_agent as) Default Directory (persistent) \u00b6 If the server hosting daos_server or daos_agent will be rebooted often, systemd provides a persistent mechanism for creating the required directories called tmpfiles.d. This mechanism will be required every time the system is provisioned and requires a reboot to take effect. To tell systemd to create the necessary directories for DAOS: Copy the file utils/systemd/daosfiles.conf to /etc/tmpfiles.d\\ cp utils/systemd/daosfiles.conf /etc/tmpfiles.d Modify the copied file to change the user and group fields (currently daos) to the user daos will be run as Reboot the system, and the directories will be created automatically on all subsequent reboots. Elevated Privileges \u00b6 DAOS employs a privileged helper binary ( daos_admin ) to perform tasks that require elevated privileges on behalf of daos_server . Privileged Helper Configuration \u00b6 When DAOS is installed from RPM, the daos_admin helper is automatically installed to the correct location with the correct permissions. The RPM creates a \"daos_admins\" system group and configures permissions such that daos_admin may only be invoked from daos_server . For non-RPM installations, there are two supported scenarios: daos_server is run as root, which means that daos_admin is also invoked as root, and therefore no additional setup is necessary daos_server is run as a non-root user, which means that daos_admin must be manually installed and configured The steps to enable the second scenario are as follows (steps are assumed to be running out of a DAOS source tree which may be on a NFS share): $ chmod -x $SL_PREFIX/bin/daos_admin # prevent this copy from being executed $ sudo cp $SL_PREFIX/bin/daos_admin /usr/bin/daos_admin $ sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/daos_admin # make this copy setuid root $ sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/daos/control # create symlinks to SPDK scripts $ sudo ln -sf $SL_PREFIX/share/daos/control/setup_spdk.sh \\ /usr/share/daos/control $ sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/spdk/scripts $ sudo ln -sf $SL_PREFIX/share/spdk/scripts/setup.sh \\ /usr/share/spdk/scripts $ sudo ln -sf $SL_PREFIX/share/spdk/scripts/common.sh \\ /usr/share/spdk/scripts $ sudo ln -s $SL_PREFIX/include \\ /usr/share/spdk/include Note The RPM installation is preferred for production scenarios. Manual installation is most appropriate for development and predeployment proof-of-concept scenarios. DAOS Server Setup \u00b6 First of all, the DAOS server should be started to allow remote administration command to be executed via the dmg tool. This section describes the minimal DAOS server configuration and how to start it on all the storage nodes. Server Configuration File \u00b6 The daos_server configuration file is parsed when starting the daos_server process. The configuration file location can be specified on the command line ( daos_server -h for usage) or default location ( install/etc/daos_server.yml ). Parameter descriptions are specified in daos_server.yml and example configuration files in the examples directory. Any option supplied to daos_server as a command line option or flag will take precedence over equivalent configuration file parameter. For convenience, active parsed configuration values are written to a temporary file for reference, and the location will be written to the log. Configuration Options \u00b6 The example configuration file lists the default empty configuration, listing all the options (living documentation of the config file). Live examples are available at https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/tree/master/utils/config/examples The location of this configuration file is determined by first checking for the path specified through the -o option of the daos_server command line. Otherwise, /etc/daos_server.conf is used. Refer to the example configuration file ( daos_server.yml ) for latest information and examples. At this point of the process, the servers: and provider: section of the yaml file can be left blank and will be populated in the subsequent sections. Certificate Configuration \u00b6 The DAOS security framework relies on certificates to authenticate components and administrators in addition to encrypting DAOS control plane communications. A set of certificates for a given DAOS system may be generated by running the gen_certificates.sh script provided with the DAOS DAOS software if there is not an existing TLS certificate infrastructure. When DAOS is installed from RPMs, this script is provided in the base daos RPM, and may be invoked in the directory to which the certificates will be written. As part of the generation process, a new local Certificate Authority is created to handle certificate signing, and three role certificates are created: # /usr/lib64/daos/certgen/gen_certificates.sh Generating Private CA Root Certificate Private CA Root Certificate created in ./daosCA ... Generating Server Certificate Required Server Certificate Files: ./daosCA/certs/daosCA.crt ./daosCA/certs/server.key ./daosCA/certs/server.crt ... Generating Agent Certificate Required Agent Certificate Files: ./daosCA/certs/daosCA.crt ./daosCA/certs/agent.key ./daosCA/certs/agent.crt ... Generating Admin Certificate Required Admin Certificate Files: ./daosCA/certs/daosCA.crt ./daosCA/certs/admin.key ./daosCA/certs/admin.crt The files generated under ./daosCA should be protected from unauthorized access and preserved for future use. The generated keys and certificates must then be securely distributed to all nodes participating in the DAOS system (servers, clients, and admin nodes). Permissions for these files should be set to prevent unauthorized access to the keys and certificates. After the certificates have been securely distributed, the DAOS configuration files must be updated in order to enable authentication and secure communications. These examples assume that the configuration files have been installed under /etc/daos : # /etc/daos/daos_server.yml (servers) transport_config: # Location where daos_server will look for Client certificates client_cert_dir: /etc/daos/clients # Custom CA Root certificate for generated certs ca_cert: /etc/daos/daosCA.crt # Server certificate for use in TLS handshakes cert: /etc/daos/server.crt # Key portion of Server Certificate key: /etc/daos/server.key # /etc/daos/daos_agent.yml (clients) transport_config: # Custom CA Root certificate for generated certs ca_cert: /etc/daos/daosCA.crt # Agent certificate for use in TLS handshakes cert: /etc/daos/agent.crt # Key portion of Agent Certificate key: /etc/daos/agent.key # /etc/daos/daos.yml (dmg/admin) transport_config: # Custom CA Root certificate for generated certs ca_cert: /etc/daos/daosCA.crt # Admin certificate for use in TLS handshakes cert: /etc/daos/admin.crt # Key portion of Admin Certificate key: /etc/daos/admin.key Server Startup \u00b6 One instance of the daos_server process is to be started per storage node. The server can be started either individually (e.g. independently on each storage node via systemd) or collectively (e.g. pdsh, mpirun or as a Kubernetes Pod). Parallel Launcher \u00b6 Practically any parallel launcher can be used to start the DAOS server collectively on a set of storage nodes. pdsh, clush and orterun are most commonly used. $ clush -w <server_list> -o \"-t -t\" daos_server start -o <config_file>` will launch daos_server on the specified hosts connecting to the port parameter value specified in the server config file. If the number of storage node exceed the default fanout value, then \"-f\" followed by the number of storage nodes should be used. Similarly, pdsh can be used: $ pdsh -w <server_list> daos_server start -o <config_file>` As for orterun, the list of storage nodes can be specified on the command line via the -H option. To start the DAOS server, run: $ orterun --map-by node --mca btl tcp,self --mca oob tcp -np <num_servers> -H <server_list> --enable-recovery daos_server start -o <config_file> The --enable-recovery is required for fault tolerance to guarantee that the fault of one server does not cause the others to be stopped. The --allow-run-as-root option can be added to the command line to allow the daos_server to run with root privileges on each storage nodes (for example when needing to perform privileged tasks relating to storage format). See the orterun(1) man page for additional options. Systemd Integration \u00b6 DAOS Server can be started as a systemd service. The DAOS Server unit file is installed in the correct location when installing from RPMs. If you wish to use systemd with a development build, you must copy the service file from utils/systemd to /usr/lib/systemd/system. Once the file is copied modify the ExecStart line to point to your in tree daos_server binary. Once the service file is installed you can start daos_server with the following commands: $ systemctl enable daos-server $ systemctl start daos-server To check the component status use: $ systemctl status daos-server If DAOS Server failed to start, check the logs with: $ journalctl --unit daos-server Kubernetes Pod \u00b6 DAOS service integration with Kubernetes is planned and will be supported in a future DAOS version. Hardware Provisioning \u00b6 Once the DAOS server started, the storage and network can be configured on the storage nodes via the dmg utility. SCM Preparation \u00b6 This section addresses how to verify that Optane DC Persistent Memory Module (DCPMM) is correctly installed on the storage nodes, and how to configure it in interleaved mode to be used by DAOS in AppDirect mode. Instructions for other types of SCM may be covered in the future. Provisioning the SCM occurs by configuring DCPM modules in AppDirect memory regions (interleaved mode) in groups of modules local to a specific socket (NUMA), and resultant nvdimm namespaces are defined by a device identifier (e.g., /dev/pmem0). DCPM preparation is required once per DAOS installation and requires the DAOS Control Servers to be running as root. This step requires a reboot to enable DCPM resource allocation changes to be read by BIOS. DCPM preparation can be performed from the management tool dmg storage prepare --scm-only or using the Control Server directly sudo daos_server storage prepare --scm-only . The first time the command is run, the SCM AppDirect regions will be created as resource allocations on any available DCPM modules (one region per NUMA node/socket). The regions are activated after BIOS reads the new resource allocations, and after initial completion the command prints a message to ask for a reboot (the command will not initiate reboot itself). After running the command a reboot will be required, then the Control Servers will then need to be started again and the command run for a second time to expose the namespace device to be used by DAOS. Example usage: dmg -l wolf-[118-121,130-133] -i storage prepare --scm-only after running, the user should be prompted for a reboot. clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] reboot clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] daos_server start -o utils/config/examples/daos_server_sockets.yml dmg -l wolf-[118-121,130-133] -i storage prepare --scm-only after running, /dev/pmemX devices should be available on each of the hosts. 'sudo daos_server storage prepare --scm-only' should be run for a second time after system reboot to create the pmem kernel devices (/dev/pmemX namespaces created on the new SCM regions). On the second run, one namespace per region is created, and each namespace may take up to a few minutes to create. Details of the pmem devices will be displayed in JSON format on command completion. Example output from the initial call (with the SCM modules set to default MemoryMode): Memory allocation goals for SCM will be changed and namespaces modified, this will be a destructive operation. ensure namespaces are unmounted and SCM is otherwise unused. A reboot is required to process new memory allocation goals. Example output from the subsequent call (SCM modules configured to AppDirect mode, and host rebooted): Memory allocation goals for SCM will be changed and namespaces modified. This will be a destructive operation. Ensure namespaces are unmounted and the SCM is otherwise unused. creating SCM namespace, may take a few minutes... creating SCM namespace, may take a few minutes... Persistent memory kernel devices: [{UUID:5d2f2517-9217-4d7d-9c32-70731c9ac11e Blockdev:pmem1 Dev:namespace1.0 NumaNode:1} {UUID:2bfe6c40-f79a-4b8e-bddf-ba81d4427b9b Blockdev:pmem0 Dev:namespace0.0 NumaNode:0}] Upon successful creation of the pmem devices, DCPMM is properly configured and one can move on to the next step. If required, the pmem devices can be destroyed via the --reset option: sudo daos_server [<app_opts>] storage prepare [--scm-only|-s] --reset [<cmd_opts>] All namespaces are disabled and destroyed. The SCM regions are removed by resetting modules into \"MemoryMode\" through resource allocations. Note that undefined behavior may result if the namespaces/pmem kernel devices are mounted before running reset (as per the printed warning). A subsequent reboot is required for BIOS to read the new resource allocations. Example output when resetting the SCM modules: Memory allocation goals for SCM will be changed and namespaces modified, this will be a destructive operation. ensure namespaces are unmounted and SCM is otherwise unused. removing SCM namespace, may take a few minutes... removing SCM namespace, may take a few minutes... resetting SCM memory allocations A reboot is required to process new memory allocation goals. Storage Selection \u00b6 While the DAOS server auto-detects all the usable storage, the administrator will still be provided with the ability through the configuration file (see next section) to whitelist or blacklist the storage devices to be (or not) used. This section covers how to manually detect the storage devices potentially usable by DAOS to populate the configuration file when the administrator wants to have finer control over the storage selection. dmg storage scan can be run to query remote running daos_server processes over the management network. sudo daos_server storage scan can be used to query daos_server directly (scans locally-attached SSDs and Intel Persistent Memory Modules usable by DAOS). [daos@wolf-72 daos_m]$ dmg -l wolf-7[1-2] -i storage scan --verbose wolf-[71-72]:10001: connected ------------ wolf-[71-72] ------------ SCM Namespace Socket ID Capacity ------------- --------- -------- pmem0 0 2.90TB pmem1 1 2.90TB NVMe PCI Model FW Revision Socket ID Capacity -------- ----- ----------- --------- -------- 0000:81:00.0 INTEL SSDPED1K750GA E2010325 1 750.00GB 0000:87:00.0 INTEL SSDPEDMD016T4 8DV10171 1 1.56TB 0000:da:00.0 INTEL SSDPED1K750GA E2010325 1 750.00GB The NVMe PCI field above is what should be used in the server configuration file to identified NVMe SSDs.

Note that other storage query commands are also available, dmg storage --help for listings. SSD health state can be verified via dmg storage query nvme-health : $ dmg -l wolf-71 storage query nvme-health wolf-71:10001: connected wolf-71:10001 NVMe controllers and namespaces detail with health statistics: PCI:0000:81:00.0 Model:INTEL SSDPED1K750GA FW:E2010325 Socket:1 Capacity:750TB Health Stats: Temperature:288K(15C) Controller Busy Time:5h26m0s Power Cycles:4 Power On Duration:16488h0m0s Unsafe Shutdowns:2 Media Errors:0 Error Log Entries:0 Critical Warnings: Temperature: OK Available Spare: OK Device Reliability: OK Read Only: OK Volatile Memory Backup: OK The next step consists of adjusting in the server configuration the storage devices that should be used by DAOS. The servers section of the yaml is a list specifying details for each DAOS I/O instance to be started on the host (currently a maximum of 2 per host is imposed).

Results are ordered from highest performance at the top to lowest performance at the bottom of the list. Once the fabric_iface and provider pair has been chosen, those items and the pinned_numa_node may be inserted directly into the corresponding sections within daos_server.yml. Note that the provider is currently the same for all DAOS IO server instances and is configured once in the server configuration. The fabric_iface and pinned_numa_node are configured for each IO server instance. A list of providers that may be querried is found with the command: $ daos_server network list Supported providers: ofi+gni, ofi+psm2, ofi+tcp, ofi+sockets, ofi+verbs, ofi_rxm Performing a network scan that filters on a specific provider is accomplished by issuing the following command: $ daos_server network scan --provider 'ofi+verbs;ofi_rxm' Scanning fabric for cmdline specified provider: ofi+verbs;ofi_rxm Fabric scan found 2 devices matching the provider spec: ofi+verbs;ofi_rxm fabric_iface: ib0 provider: ofi+verbs;ofi_rxm pinned_numa_node: 0 fabric_iface: ib1 provider: ofi+verbs;ofi_rxm pinned_numa_node: 1 To aid in provider configuration and debug, it may be helpful to run the fi_pingpong test (delivered as part of OFI/libfabric). To run that test, determine the name of the provider to test usually by removing the \"ofi+\" prefix from the network scan provider data. Do use the \"ofi+\" prefix in the daos_server.yml. Do not use the \"ofi+\" prefix with fi_pingpong. Then, the fi_pingpong test can be used to verify that the targeted OFI provider works fine: node1$ fi_pingpong -p psm2 node2$ fi_pingpong -p psm2 ${IP_ADDRESS_NODE1} bytes #sent #ack total time MB/sec usec/xfer Mxfers/sec 64 10 =10 1.2k 0.00s 21.69 2.95 0.34 256 10 =10 5k 0.00s 116.36 2.20 0.45 1k 10 =10 20k 0.00s 379.26 2.70 0.37 4k 10 =10 80k 0.00s 1077.89 3.80 0.26 64k 10 =10 1.2m 0.00s 2145.20 30.55 0.03 1m 10 =10 20m 0.00s 8867.45 118.25 0.01 Storage Formatting \u00b6 Once the daos_server has been restarted with the correct storage devices and network interface to use, one can move to the format phase. When daos_server is started for the first time, it enters \"maintenance mode\" and waits for a dmg storage format call to be issued from the management tool. This remote call will trigger the formatting of the locally attached storage on the host for use with DAOS using the parameters defined in the server config file. dmg -i -l <host:port>[,...] storage format will normally be run on a login node specifying a hostlist ( -l <host:port>[,...] ) of storage nodes with SCM/DCPM modules and NVMe SSDs installed and prepared. Upon successful format, DAOS Control Servers will start DAOS IO instances that have been specified in the server config file. Successful start-up is indicated by the following on stdout: DAOS I/O server (v0.8.0) process 433456 started on rank 1 with 8 target, 2 helper XS per target, firstcore 0, host wolf-72.wolf.hpdd.intel.com. SCM Format \u00b6 When the command is run, the pmem kernel devices created on SCM/DCPM regions are formatted and mounted based on the parameters provided in the server config file. scm_mount specifies the location of the mountpoint to create. scm_class can be set to ram to use a tmpfs in the situation that no SCM/DCPM is available (scm_size dictates the size of tmpfs in GB), when set to dcpm the device specified under scm_list will be mounted at scm_mount path. NVMe Format \u00b6 When the command is run, NVMe SSDs are formatted and set up to be used by DAOS based on the parameters provided in the server config file. bdev_class can be set to nvme to use actual NVMe devices with SPDK for DAOS storage. Other bdev_class values can be used for emulation of NVMe storage as specified in the server config file. bdev_list identifies devices to use with a list of PCI addresses (this can be populated after viewing results from storage scan command). After the format command is run, the path specified by the server configuration file scm_mount parameter should be mounted and should contain a file named daos_nvme.conf . The file should describe the devices with PCI addresses as listed in the bdev_list parameter of the server config file. The presence and contents of the file indicate that the specified NVMe SSDs have been configured correctly for use with DAOS. The contents of the NVMe SSDs listed in the server configuration file bdev_list parameter will be reset on format. Server Format \u00b6 Before the format command is run, no DAOS metadata should exist under the path specified by scm_mount parameter in the server configuration file. After the storage format command is run, the path specified by the server configuration file scm_mount parameter should be mounted and should contain the necessary DAOS metadata indicating that the server has been formatted. When starting, daos_server will skip maintenance mode and attempt to start IO services if valid DAOS metadata is found in scm_mount . Agent Setup \u00b6 This section addresses how to configure the DAOS agents on the storage nodes before starting it. Agent Certificate Generation \u00b6 The DAOS security framework relies on certificates to authenticate administrators. The security infrastructure is currently under development and will be delivered in DAOS v1.0. Initial support for certificates has been added to DAOS and can be disabled either via the command line or in the DAOS Agent configuration file. Currently, the easiest way to disable certificate support is to pass the -i flag to daos_agent. Agent Configuration File \u00b6 The daos_agent configuration file is parsed when starting the daos_agent process. The configuration file location can be specified on the command line ( daos_agent -h for usage) or default location ( install/etc/daos_agent.yml ). If installed from rpms the default location is ( /usr/etc/daos_agent.yml ). Parameter descriptions are specified in daos_agent.yml . Any option supplied to daos_agent as a command line option or flag will take precedence over equivalent configuration file parameter. For convenience, active parsed config values are written to a temporary file for reference, and the location will be written to the log. The following section lists the format, options, defaults, and descriptions available in the configuration file. The example configuration file lists the default empty configuration listing all the options (living documentation of the config file). Live examples are available at https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/tree/master/utils/config The location of this configuration file is determined by first checking for the path specified through the -o option of the daos_agent command line. Otherwise, /etc/daos_agent.conf is used. Refer to the example configuration file ( daos_server.yml ) for latest information and examples. Agent Startup \u00b6 DAOS Agent is a standalone application to be run on each compute node. It can be configured to use secure communications (default) or can be allowed to communicate with the control plane over unencrypted channels. The following example shows daos_agent being configured to operate in insecure mode due to incomplete integration of certificate support as of the 0.6 release and configured to use a non-default agent configuration file. To start the DAOS Agent from the command line, run: $ daos_agent -i -o <'path to agent configuration file/daos_agent.yml'> & Alternatively, the DAOS Agent can be started as a systemd service. The DAOS Agent unit file is installed in the correct location when installing from RPMs. If you wish to use systemd with a development build, you must copy the service file from utils/systemd to /usr/lib/systemd/system. Once the file is copied modify the ExecStart line to point to your in tree daos_agent binary. ExecStart=/usr/bin/daos_agent -i -o <'path to agent configuration file/daos_agent.yml'> Once the service file is installed, you can start daos_agent with the following commands: $ sudo systemctl enable daos-agent $ sudo systemctl start daos-agent To check the component status use: $ sudo systemctl status daos-agent If DAOS Agent failed to start check the logs with: $ sudo journalctl --unit daos-agent System Validation \u00b6 To validate that the DAOS system is properly installed, the daos_test suite can be executed. Ensure the DAOS Agent is configured and running before running daos_test and that the DAOS_SINGLETON_CLI and CRT_ATTACH_INFO_PATH environment variables are properly set as described here . mpirun -np <num_clients> --hostfile <hostfile> ./daos_test daos_test requires at least 8GB of SCM (or DRAM with tmpfs) storage on each storage node. https://github.com/intel/ipmctl \u21a9 https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/tree/master/utils/config \u21a9 https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running#mpirun-hostfile \u21a9 https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/tree/master/src/control/README.md \u21a9","title":"System Deployment"},{"location":"admin/deployment/#system-deployment","text":"The DAOS deployment workflow requires to start the DAOS server instances early on to enable administrators to perform remote operations in parallel across multiple storage nodes via the dmg management utility.

After daos_server instances have been started on each storage node for the first time, dmg storage prepare will set DCPM storage into the necessary state for use with DAOS. Then dmg storage format formats persistent storage devices (specified in the server configuration file) on the storage nodes and writes necessary metadata before starting DAOS I/O processes that will operate across the fabric.

Provisioning the SCM occurs by configuring DCPM modules in AppDirect memory regions (interleaved mode) in groups of modules local to a specific socket (NUMA), and resultant nvdimm namespaces are defined by a device identifier (e.g., /dev/pmem0). DCPM preparation is required once per DAOS installation and requires the DAOS Control Servers to be running as root. This step requires a reboot to enable DCPM resource allocation changes to be read by BIOS. DCPM preparation can be performed from the management tool dmg storage prepare --scm-only or using the Control Server directly sudo daos_server storage prepare --scm-only . The first time the command is run, the SCM AppDirect regions will be created as resource allocations on any available DCPM modules (one region per NUMA node/socket). The regions are activated after BIOS reads the new resource allocations, and after initial completion the command prints a message to ask for a reboot (the command will not initiate reboot itself). After running the command a reboot will be required, then the Control Servers will then need to be started again and the command run for a second time to expose the namespace device to be used by DAOS. Example usage: dmg -l wolf-[118-121,130-133] -i storage prepare --scm-only after running, the user should be prompted for a reboot. clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] reboot clush -w wolf-[118-121,130-133] daos_server start -o utils/config/examples/daos_server_sockets.yml dmg -l wolf-[118-121,130-133] -i storage prepare --scm-only after running, /dev/pmemX devices should be available on each of the hosts.

If required, the pmem devices can be destroyed via the --reset option: sudo daos_server [<app_opts>] storage prepare [--scm-only|-s] --reset [<cmd_opts>] All namespaces are disabled and destroyed. The SCM regions are removed by resetting modules into \"MemoryMode\" through resource allocations.

Deployment Options \u00b6 As illustrated in the figure below, a DAOS system can be deployed in two different ways: Pooled Storage Model : The DAOS servers can run on dedicated storage nodes in separate racks. This is a traditional pool model where storage is uniformly accessed by all compute nodes. In order to minimize the number of I/O racks and to optimize floor space, this approach usually requires high-density storage servers. Disaggregated Storage Model : In the disaggregated model, the storage nodes are integrated into compute racks and can be either dedicated or shared (e.g., in a hyper-converged infrastructure) nodes. The DAOS servers are thus massively distributed and storage access is non-uniform and must take locality into account. This model is common in hyperconverged infrastructure. While DAOS is mostly deployed following the pooled model, active research is conducted to efficiently support the disaggregated model as well. Processor Requirements \u00b6 DAOS requires a 64-bit processor architecture and is primarily developed on Intel 64 architecture. The DAOS software and the libraries it depends on (e.g., ISA-L, SPDK, PMDK, and DPDK) can take advantage of Intel SSE and AVX extensions. DAOS is also regularly tested on 64-bit ARM processors configured in Little Endian mode. The same build instructions that are used for x86-64 are applicable for ARM builds as well. DAOS and its dependencies will make the necessary adjustments automatically in their respective build systems for ARM platforms. Network Requirements \u00b6 The DAOS network layer relies on libfabrics and supports OFI providers for Ethernet/sockets, InfiniBand/verbs, RoCE, Cray's GNI, and the Intel Omni-Path Architecture. An RDMA-capable fabric is preferred for better performance. DAOS can support multiple rails by binding different instances of the DAOS server to individual network cards. An additional out-of-band network connecting the nodes in the DAOS service cluster is required for DAOS administration. Management traffic uses IP over Fabric. Storage Requirements \u00b6 DAOS requires each storage node to have direct access to storage-class memory (SCM). While DAOS is primarily tested and tuned for Optane DC Persistent Memory, the DAOS software stack is built over the Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK) and the DAX feature of the Linux and Windows operating systems as described in the SNIA NVM Programming Model 1 . As a result, the open-source DAOS software stack should be able to run transparently over any storage-class memory supported by PMDK. The storage node can be optionally equipped with NVMe (non-volatile memory express) SSDs to provide capacity. HDDs, as well as SATA and SAS SSDs, are not supported by DAOS. Both NVMe 3D-NAND and Optane SSDs are supported. Optane SSDs are preferred for DAOS installation that targets a very high IOPS rate. NVMe-oF devices are also supported by the userspace storage stack, but have never been tested. The minimal recommended ratio between SCM and SSDs capacity is 6% to guarantee that DAOS has enough space in SCM to store internal metadata (e.g., pool metadata, SSD block allocation tracking). For testing purposes, SCM can be emulated with DRAM by mounting a tmpfs filesystem, and NVMe SSDs can be also emulated with DRAM or a loopback file. CPU Affinity \u00b6 On recent Xeon platforms, PCIe slots have a natural affinity to one CPU. Although globally accessible from any of the system cores, NVMe SSDs and network interface cards connected through the PCIe bus may provide different performance characteristics (e.g., higher latency, lower bandwidth) to each CPU. Accessing non-local PCIe devices may involve traffic over the UPI (Ultra Path Interconnect) link that might become a point of congestion. Similarly, persistent memory is non-uniformly accessible (NUMA), and CPU affinity must be respected for maximal performance. Therefore, when running in a multi-socket and multi-rail environment, the DAOS service must be able to detect the CPU to PCIe device and persistent memory affinity and minimize as much as possible non-local access. This can be achieved by spawning one instance of the I/O server per CPU, then accessing only local persistent memory and PCI devices from that server instance. The control plane is responsible for detecting the storage and network affinity and starting the I/O servers accordingly. Fault Domains \u00b6 DAOS relies on single-ported storage massively distributed across different storage nodes. Each storage node is thus a single point of failure. DAOS achieves fault tolerance by providing data redundancy across storage nodes in different fault domains. DAOS assumes that fault domains are hierarchical and do not overlap.

This is a traditional pool model where storage is uniformly accessed by all compute nodes. In order to minimize the number of I/O racks and to optimize floor space, this approach usually requires high-density storage servers. Disaggregated Storage Model : In the disaggregated model, the storage nodes are integrated into compute racks and can be either dedicated or shared (e.g., in a hyper-converged infrastructure) nodes. The DAOS servers are thus massively distributed and storage access is non-uniform and must take locality into account. This model is common in hyperconverged infrastructure. While DAOS is mostly deployed following the pooled model, active research is conducted to efficiently support the disaggregated model as well.","title":"Deployment Options"},{"location":"admin/hardware/#processor-requirements","text":"DAOS requires a 64-bit processor architecture and is primarily developed on Intel 64 architecture. The DAOS software and the libraries it depends on (e.g., ISA-L, SPDK, PMDK, and DPDK) can take advantage of Intel SSE and AVX extensions. DAOS is also regularly tested on 64-bit ARM processors configured in Little Endian mode. The same build instructions that are used for x86-64 are applicable for ARM builds as well. DAOS and its dependencies will make the necessary adjustments automatically in their respective build systems for ARM platforms.","title":"Processor Requirements"},{"location":"admin/hardware/#network-requirements","text":"The DAOS network layer relies on libfabrics and supports OFI providers for Ethernet/sockets, InfiniBand/verbs, RoCE, Cray's GNI, and the Intel Omni-Path Architecture. An RDMA-capable fabric is preferred for better performance. DAOS can support multiple rails by binding different instances of the DAOS server to individual network cards. An additional out-of-band network connecting the nodes in the DAOS service cluster is required for DAOS administration. Management traffic uses IP over Fabric.","title":"Network Requirements"},{"location":"admin/hardware/#storage-requirements","text":"DAOS requires each storage node to have direct access to storage-class memory (SCM). While DAOS is primarily tested and tuned for Optane DC Persistent Memory, the DAOS software stack is built over the Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK) and the DAX feature of the Linux and Windows operating systems as described in the SNIA NVM Programming Model 1 . As a result, the open-source DAOS software stack should be able to run transparently over any storage-class memory supported by PMDK. The storage node can be optionally equipped with NVMe (non-volatile memory express) SSDs to provide capacity. HDDs, as well as SATA and SAS SSDs, are not supported by DAOS. Both NVMe 3D-NAND and Optane SSDs are supported. Optane SSDs are preferred for DAOS installation that targets a very high IOPS rate. NVMe-oF devices are also supported by the userspace storage stack, but have never been tested. The minimal recommended ratio between SCM and SSDs capacity is 6% to guarantee that DAOS has enough space in SCM to store internal metadata (e.g., pool metadata, SSD block allocation tracking). For testing purposes, SCM can be emulated with DRAM by mounting a tmpfs filesystem, and NVMe SSDs can be also emulated with DRAM or a loopback file.","title":"Storage Requirements"},{"location":"admin/hardware/#cpu-affinity","text":"On recent Xeon platforms, PCIe slots have a natural affinity to one CPU. Although globally accessible from any of the system cores, NVMe SSDs and network interface cards connected through the PCIe bus may provide different performance characteristics (e.g., higher latency, lower bandwidth) to each CPU. Accessing non-local PCIe devices may involve traffic over the UPI (Ultra Path Interconnect) link that might become a point of congestion. Similarly, persistent memory is non-uniformly accessible (NUMA), and CPU affinity must be respected for maximal performance. Therefore, when running in a multi-socket and multi-rail environment, the DAOS service must be able to detect the CPU to PCIe device and persistent memory affinity and minimize as much as possible non-local access. This can be achieved by spawning one instance of the I/O server per CPU, then accessing only local persistent memory and PCI devices from that server instance. The control plane is responsible for detecting the storage and network affinity and starting the I/O servers accordingly.","title":"CPU Affinity"},{"location":"admin/hardware/#fault-domains","text":"DAOS relies on single-ported storage massively distributed across different storage nodes. Each storage node is thus a single point of failure. DAOS achieves fault tolerance by providing data redundancy across storage nodes in different fault domains.

Software Dependencies \u00b6 DAOS requires a C99-capable compiler, a Go compiler, and the scons build tool. Moreover, the DAOS stack leverages the following open source projects: CaRT for high-performance communication leveraging advanced network capabilities. gRPC provides a secured out-of-band channel for DAOS administration. PMDK for persistent memory programming. SPDK for userspace NVMe device access and management. FIO for flexible testing of Linux I/O subsystems, specifically enabling validation of userspace NVMe device performance through fio-spdk plugin. ISA-L for checksum and erasure code computation. Argobots for thread management. hwloc for discovering system devices, detecting their NUMA node affinity and for CPU binding libfabric for detecting fabric interfaces, providers and connection management. The DAOS build system can be configured to download and build any missing dependencies automatically. Distribution Packages \u00b6 DAOS RPM and deb packaging is under development and will be available for DAOS v1.0. Integration with the Spack package manager is also under consideration. DAOS from Scratch \u00b6 The following instructions have been verified with CentOS. Installations on other Linux distributions might be similar with some variations. Developers of DAOS may want to review the additional sections below before beginning, for suggestions related specifically to development. Contact us in our forum for further help with any issues. Build Prerequisites \u00b6 To build DAOS and its dependencies, several software packages must be installed on the system. This includes scons, libuuid, cmocka, ipmctl, and several other packages usually available on all the Linux distributions. Moreover, a Go version of at least 1.10 is required. An exhaustive list of packages for each supported Linux distribution is maintained in the Docker files: CentOS OpenSUSE Ubuntu The command lines to install the required packages can be extracted from the Docker files by removing the \"RUN\" command, which is specific to Docker. Check the docker directory for different Linux distribution versions. Some DAOS tests use MPI. The DAOS build process uses the environment modules package to detect the presence of MPI. If none is found, the build will skip building those tests. DAOS Source Code \u00b6 To check out the DAOS source code, run the following command: $ git clone https://github.com/daos-stack/daos.git This command clones the DAOS git repository (path referred as ${daospath} below). Then initialize the submodules with: $ cd ${daospath} $ git submodule init $ git submodule update Building DAOS & Dependencies \u00b6 If all the software dependencies listed previously are already satisfied, then type the following command in the top source directory to build the DAOS stack: $ scons --config=force install If you are a developer of DAOS, we recommend following the instructions in the DAOS for Development section. Otherwise, the missing dependencies can be built automatically by invoking scons with the following parameters: $ scons --config=force --build-deps=yes install By default, DAOS and its dependencies are installed under ${daospath}/install. The installation path can be modified by adding the PREFIX= option to the above command line (e.g., PREFIX=/usr/local). Note If you wish to compile DAOS with clang or use the Intel compilers rather than gcc, set COMPILER=clang or COMPILER=icc on the scons command line. This option is also saved for future compilations. Environment setup \u00b6 Once built, the environment must be modified to search for binaries and header files in the installation path. This step is not required if standard locations (e.g. /bin, /sbin, /usr/lib, ...) are used. CPATH=${daospath}/install/include/:$CPATH PATH=${daospath}/install/bin/:${daospath}/install/sbin:$PATH export CPATH PATH If using bash, PATH can be set up for you after a build by sourcing the script scons_local/utils/setup_local.sh from the daos root. This script utilizes a file generated by the build to determine the location of daos and its dependencies. If required, ${daospath}/install must be replaced with the alternative path specified through PREFIX. DAOS in Docker \u00b6 This section describes how to build and run the DAOS service in a Docker container. A minimum of 5GB of DRAM and 16GB of disk space will be required. On Mac, please make sure that the Docker settings under \"Preferences/{Disk,Memory}\" are configured accordingly. Building from GitHub \u00b6 To build the Docker image directly from GitHub, run the following command: $ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daos-stack/daos/master/utils/docker/Dockerfile.centos.7 | \\ docker build --no-cache -t daos - This creates a CentOS 7 image, fetches the latest DAOS version from GitHub, builds it, and installs it in the image. For Ubuntu and other Linux distributions, replace Dockerfile.centos.7 with Dockerfile.ubuntu.18.04 and the appropriate version of interest. Once the image created, one can start a container that will eventually run the DAOS service: $ docker run -it -d --privileged --name server \\ -v /dev/hugepages:/dev/hugepages \\ daos If Docker is being run on a non-Linux system (e.g., OSX), the export of /dev/hugepages should be removed since it is not supported. Building from a Local Tree \u00b6 To build from a local tree stored on the host, a volume must be created to share the source tree with the Docker container. To do so, execute the following command to create a docker image without checking out the DAOS source tree: $ docker build -t daos -f utils/docker/Dockerfile.centos.7 --build-arg NOBUILD=1 . Then create a container that can access the local DAOS source tree: $ docker run -it -d --privileged --name server \\ -v ${daospath}:/home/daos/daos:Z \\ -v /dev/hugepages:/dev/hugepages \\ daos ${daospath} should be replaced with the full path to your DAOS source tree. As mentioned above, the export of /dev/hugepages should be removed if the host is not a Linux system. Then execute the following command to build and install DAOS in the container: $ docker exec server scons --build-deps=yes install PREFIX=/usr Running DAOS in Docker \u00b6 The DAOS service can be started as follows: $ docker exec server mkdir /var/run/daos_server $ docker exec server daos_server start \\ -o /home/daos/daos/utils/config/examples/daos_server_local.yml The daos_server_local.yml configuration file sets up a simple local DAOS system with a single server instance running in the container. By default, it uses 4GB of DRAM to emulate persistent memory and 16GB of bulk storage under /tmp. The storage size can be changed in the yaml file if necessary. Once started, the DAOS server waits for the administrator to format the system. This can be triggered in a different shell, using the following command: $ docker exec server dmg -i storage format Upon successful completion of the format, the storage engine is started, and pools can be created using the daos admin tool (see next section).

The UUID allocated to the newly created pool is printed to stdout (referred as ${puuid}) as well as the rank where the pool service is located (referred as ${svcl}). $ dmg pool create --help ...

To destroy a pool: $ dmg pool destroy --pool=${puuid} To see a list of the pools in your DAOS system: $ dmg system list-pools This will return a table of pool UUIDs and the ranks of their pool service replicas.

DAOS_PROP_PO_SELF_HEAL defines whether the pool wants automatically-trigger, or manually-triggered self-healing. DAOS_PROP_PO_RECLAIM is used to tune the space reclaim strategy based on time interval, batched commits or snapshot creation. While those pool properties are currently stored persistently with pool metadata, many of them are still under development. Moreover, the ability to modify some of those properties on an existing pool will also be provided in a future release. Pool Access Control Lists \u00b6 User and group access for pools is controlled by Access Control Lists (ACLs). A DAOS ACL is a list of zero or more Access Control Entries (ACEs). ACEs are the individual rules applied to each access decision. If no ACL is provided when creating the pool, the default ACL grants read and write access to the pool's owner-user and owner-group. Access Control Entries \u00b6 ACEs are designated by a colon-separated string format: TYPE:FLAGS:IDENTITY:PERMISSIONS Available values for these fields: TYPE: Allow (A) FLAGS: Group (G) IDENTITY: See below PERMISSIONS: Read (r), Write (w) Identity \u00b6 The identity (also called the principal) is specified in the name@domain format. The domain should be left off if the name is a user/group on the local domain. Currently, this is the only case supported by DAOS. There are three special identities, OWNER@ , GROUP@ and EVERYONE@ , which align with User, Group, and Other from traditional POSIX permission bits. When providing them in the ACE string format, they must be spelled exactly as written here, in uppercase with no domain appended. Examples \u00b6 A::daos_user@:rw Allow the UNIX user named daos_user to have read-write access A:G:project_users@:r Allow anyone in the UNIX group project_users to have read-only access A::EVERYONE@:r Allow any user not covered by other rules to have read-only access Enforcement \u00b6 Access Control Entries (ACEs) will be enforced in the following order: Owner-User Named users Owner-Group and named groups Everyone In general, enforcement will be based on the first match, ignoring lower-priority entries. For example, if the user has an ACE for their user identity, they will not receive the permissions for any of their groups, even if those group entries have broader permissions than the user entry does. The user is expected to match at most one user entry. If no matching user entry is found, but entries match one or more of the user's groups, enforcement will be based on the union of the permissions of all matching groups. By default, if a user matches no ACEs in the list, access will be denied. Limitations \u00b6 The maximum length of the ACE list in a DAOS ACL structure is 64KiB. To calculate the actual length of an ACL, use the following formula for each ACE: The base size of an ACE is 256B. If the ACE principal is not one of the special principals: Add the length of the identity string + 1. If that value is not 64B aligned, round up to the nearest 64B boundary. Creating a pool with a custom ACL \u00b6 To create a pool with a custom ACL: $ dmg pool create --scm-size <size> --acl-file <path> The ACL file is expected to be a text file with one ACE listed on each line. For example: # Entries: A::OWNER@:rw A:G:GROUP@:rw # Everyone should be allowed to read A::EVERYONE@:r You may add comments to the ACL file by starting the line with # . Displaying a pool's ACL \u00b6 To view a pool's ACL: $ dmg pool get-acl --pool <UUID> The output is in the same string format used in the ACL file during creation, with one ACE per line. Modifying a pool's ACL \u00b6 For all of these commands using an ACL file, the ACL file must be in the format noted above for pool creation. Overwriting the ACL \u00b6 To replace a pool's ACL with a new ACL: $ dmg pool overwrite-acl --pool <UUID> --acl-file <path> Updating entries in an existing ACL \u00b6 To add or update multiple entries in an existing pool ACL: $ dmg pool update-acl --pool <UUID> --acl-file <path> To add or update a single entry in an existing pool ACL: $ dmg pool update-acl --pool <UUID> --entry <ACE> If there is no existing entry for the principal in the ACL, the new entry is added to the ACL. If there is already an entry for the principal, that entry is replaced with the new one. Removing an entry from the ACL \u00b6 To delete an entry for a given principal, or identity, in an existing pool ACL: $ dmg pool delete-acl --pool <UUID> --principal <principal> The principal corresponds to the principal/identity portion of an ACE that was set during pool creation or a previous pool ACL operation. For the delete operation, the principal argument must be formatted as follows: Named user: u:username@ Named group: g:groupname@ Special principals: OWNER@ GROUP@ EVERYONE@ The entry for that principal will be completely removed. This does not always mean that the principal will have no access. Rather, their access to the pool will be decided based on the remaining ACL rules. Pool Query \u00b6 The pool query operation retrieves information (i.e., the number of targets, space usage, rebuild status, property list, and more) about a created pool. It is integrated into the dmg_old utility. To query a pool: $ dmg pool query --pool <UUID> Below is the output for a pool created with SCM space only. pool=47293abe-aa6f-4147-97f6-42a9f796d64a Pool 47293abe-aa6f-4147-97f6-42a9f796d64a, ntarget=64, disabled=8 Pool space info: - Target(VOS) count:56 - SCM: Total size: 28GB Free: 28GB, min:505MB, max:512MB, mean:512MB - NVMe: Total size: 0 Free: 0, min:0, max:0, mean:0 Rebuild done, 10 objs, 1026 recs The total and free sizes are the sum across all the targets whereas min/max/mean gives information about individual targets. A min value close to 0 means that one target is running out of space. The example below shows a rebuild in progress and NVMe space allocated. pool=95886b8b-7eb8-454d-845c-fc0ae0ba5671 Pool 95886b8b-7eb8-454d-845c-fc0ae0ba5671, ntarget=64, disabled=8 Pool space info: - Target(VOS) count:56 - SCM: Total size: 28GB Free: 28GB, min:470MB, max:512MB, mean:509MB - NVMe: Total size: 56GB Free: 28GB, min:470MB, max:512MB, mean:509MB Rebuild busy, 75 objs, 9722 recs Additional status and telemetry data are planned to be exported through the management API and tool and will be documented here once available. Pool Modifications \u00b6 Target Exclusion and Self-Healing \u00b6 To exclude a target from a pool: $ dmg_old exclude --svc=${svcl} --pool=${puuid} --target=${rank} Pool Extension \u00b6 Target Addition & Space Rebalancing \u00b6 Support for online target addition and automatic space rebalancing is planned for DAOS v1.4 and will be documented here once available. Pool Shard Resize \u00b6 Support for quiescent pool shard resize is currently not supported and is under consideration. Pool Catastrophic Recovery \u00b6 A DAOS pool is instantiated on each target by a set of pmemobj files managed by PMDK and SPDK blobs on SSDs. Tools to verify and repair this persistent data is scheduled for DAOS v2.4 and will be documented here once available. Meanwhile, PMDK provides a recovery tool (i.e., pmempool check) to verify and possibly repair a pmemobj file.

The function d_errstr() is provided in the API to convert an error number to an error message. Log Files \u00b6 On the server side, there are three log files created as part of normal server operations: Component Config Parameter Example Config Value Control Plane control_log_file /tmp/daos_control.log Data Plane log_file /tmp/daos_server.log Privileged Helper helper_log_file /tmp/daos_admin.log agent log_file /tmp/daos_agent.log Control Plane Log \u00b6 The default log level for the control plane is INFO. The following levels may be set using the control_log_mask config parameter: DEBUG INFO ERROR Data Plane Log \u00b6 Data Plane ( daos_io_server ) logging is configured on a per-instance basis. In other words, each section under the servers: section must have its own logging configuration. The log_file config parameter is converted to a D_LOG_FILE environment variable value. For more detail, please see the Debugging System section of this document. Privileged Helper Log \u00b6 By default, the privileged helper only emits ERROR-level logging which is captured by the control plane and included in that log. If the helper_log_file parameter is set in the server config, then DEBUG-level logging will be sent to the specified file. Daos Agent Log \u00b6 If the log_file config parameter is set in the agent config, then DEBUG-level logging will be sent to the specified file. Debugging System \u00b6 DAOS uses the debug system defined in CaRT but more specifically the GURT library. Log files for both client and server are written to \"/tmp/daos.log\" unless otherwise set by D_LOG_FILE. Registered Subsystems/Facilities \u00b6 The debug logging system includes a series of subsystems or facilities which define groups for related log messages (defined per source file).

Unlike the traditional storage stacks that were primarily designed for rotating media, DAOS is architected from the ground up to exploit new NVM technologies and is extremely lightweight since it operates End-to-End (E2E) in user space with full OS bypass. DAOS offers a shift away from an I/O model designed for block-based and high-latency storage to one that inherently supports fine-grained data access and unlocks the performance of the next-generation storage technologies. Unlike traditional Burst Buffers, DAOS is a high-performant independent and fault-tolerant storage tier that does not rely on a third-party tier to manage metadata and data resilience. DAOS Features \u00b6 DAOS relies on OFI for low-latency communications and stores data on both storage-class memory and NVMe storage. DAOS presents a native key-array-value storage interface that offers a unified storage model over which domain-specific data models are ported, such as HDF5, MPI-IO, and Apache Arrow. A POSIX I/O emulation layer implementing files and directories over the native DAOS API is also available. DAOS I/O operations are logged and then inserted into a persistent index maintained in SCM. Each I/O is tagged with a particular timestamp called epoch and is associated with a particular version of the dataset. No read-modify-write operations are performed internally. Write operations are non-destructive and not sensitive to alignment. Upon read request, the DAOS service walks through the persistent index and creates a complex scatter-gather Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) descriptor to reconstruct the data at the requested version directly in the buffer provided by the application. The SCM storage is memory-mapped directly into the address space of the DAOS service that manages the persistent index via direct load/store. Depending on the I/O characteristics, the DAOS service can decide to store the I/O in either SCM or NVMe storage. As represented in Figure 2-1, latency-sensitive I/Os, like application metadata and byte-granular data, will typically be stored in the former, whereas checkpoints and bulk data will be stored in the latter. This approach allows DAOS to deliver the raw NVMe bandwidth for bulk data by streaming the data to NVMe storage and maintaining internal metadata index in SCM. The Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK)[^1] allows managing transactional access to SCM and the Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK)[^2] enables user-space I/O to NVMe devices. Figure 2-1. DAOS Storage DAOS aims at delivering: High throughput and IOPS at arbitrary alignment and size Fine-grained I/O operations with true zero-copy I/O to SCM Support for massively distributed NVM storage via scalable collective communications across the storage servers Non-blocking data and metadata operations to allow I/O and computation to overlap Advanced data placement taking into account fault domains Software-managed redundancy supporting both replication and erasure code with an online rebuild End-to-end data integrity Scalable distributed transactions with guaranteed data consistency and automated recovery Dataset snapshot Security framework to manage access control to storage pools Software-defined storage management to provision, configure, modify and monitor storage pools over COTS hardware Native support for Hierarchical Data Format (HDF)5, MPI-IO and POSIX namespace over the DAOS data model Tools for disaster recovery Seamless integration with the Lustre parallel filesystem Mover agent to migrate datasets among DAOS pools and from parallel filesystems to DAOS and vice versa DAOS Components \u00b6 A data center may have hundreds of thousands of compute nodes interconnected via a scalable high-performance fabric, where all, or a subset of the nodes called storage nodes, have direct access to NVM storage. A DAOS installation involves several components that can be either collocated or distributed. DAOS Target, Server and System \u00b6 The DAOS server is a multi-tenant daemon running on a Linux instance (i.e. natively on the physical node or in a VM or container) of each storage node and exporting through the network the locally-attached NVM storage. It listens to a management port, addressed by an IP address and a TCP port number, plus one or more fabric endpoints, addressed by network URIs. The DAOS server is configured through a YAML file and can be integrated with different daemon management or orchestration frameworks (e.g., a systemd script, a Kubernetes service or even via a parallel launcher like pdsh or srun). A DAOS system is identified by a system name and consists of a set of DAOS servers connected to the same fabric. Membership of the DAOS servers is recorded into the system map that assigns a unique integer rank to each server. Two different systems comprise two disjoint sets of servers and do not coordinate with each other. Inside a DAOS server, the storage is statically partitioned across multiple targets to optimize concurrency. To avoid contention, each target has its private storage, own pool of service threads and dedicated network context that can be directly addressed over the fabric independently of the other targets hosted on the same storage node. A target is typically associated with a single-ported SCM module and NVMe SSD attached to a single storage node. Moreover, a target does not implement any internal data protection mechanism against storage media failure. As a result, a target is a single point of failure. A dynamic state is associated with each target and is set to either up and running, or down and not available. A target is the unit of performance. Hardware components associated with the target, such as the backend storage medium, the server, and the network, have limited capability and capacity. The number of targets exported by a DAOS server instance is configurable and depends on the underlying hardware (i.e., the number of SCM modules, CPUs, NVMe SSDs ...). A target is the unit of fault. Storage API, Application Interface and Tools \u00b6 Applications, users, and administrators can interact with a DAOS system through two different client APIs. The management API offers the ability to administrate a DAOS system. It is intended to be integrated with different vendor-specific storage management or open-source orchestration frameworks. A CLI tool is built over the DAOS management API. On the other hand, the DAOS library (i.e., libdaos) implements the DAOS storage model and is primarily targeted at application and I/O middleware developers who want to store datasets in a DAOS system. User utilities are also built over the API to allow users to manage datasets from a CLI. Applications can access datasets stored in DAOS either directly through the native DAOS API or an I/O middleware libraries (e.g. POSIX emulation, MPI-IO, HDF5) or frameworks (e.g., Spark, TensorFlow) already integrated with the native DAOS storage model. Agent \u00b6 The DAOS agent is a daemon residing on the client node that interacts with the DAOS library to authenticate the application process. It is a trusted entity that can sign the DAOS Client credentials using certificates. The agent can support different authentication frameworks and uses a Unix Domain Socket to communicate with the client library.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"overview/architecture/#architecture","text":"DAOS is an open-source software-defined scale-out object store that provides high bandwidth and high IOPS storage containers to applications and enables next-generation data-centric workflows combining simulation, data analytics, and machine learning.

The DAOS server is configured through a YAML file and can be integrated with different daemon management or orchestration frameworks (e.g., a systemd script, a Kubernetes service or even via a parallel launcher like pdsh or srun). A DAOS system is identified by a system name and consists of a set of DAOS servers connected to the same fabric. Membership of the DAOS servers is recorded into the system map that assigns a unique integer rank to each server. Two different systems comprise two disjoint sets of servers and do not coordinate with each other. Inside a DAOS server, the storage is statically partitioned across multiple targets to optimize concurrency. To avoid contention, each target has its private storage, own pool of service threads and dedicated network context that can be directly addressed over the fabric independently of the other targets hosted on the same storage node. A target is typically associated with a single-ported SCM module and NVMe SSD attached to a single storage node. Moreover, a target does not implement any internal data protection mechanism against storage media failure. As a result, a target is a single point of failure. A dynamic state is associated with each target and is set to either up and running, or down and not available. A target is the unit of performance. Hardware components associated with the target, such as the backend storage medium, the server, and the network, have limited capability and capacity. The number of targets exported by a DAOS server instance is configurable and depends on the underlying hardware (i.e., the number of SCM modules, CPUs, NVMe SSDs ...).

While each component in the system (network layer, storage devices) may offer protection against silent data corruption, DAOS provides end-to-end data integrity using checksums to better ensure that user data is not corrupted silently. For DAOS, end-to-end means that the client will calculate and verify checksums, providing protection for data through the entire I/O stack. During a write or update, the DAOS Client library (libdaos.so) calculates a checksum and appends it to the RPC message before transferred over the network. Depending on the situation, the DAOS Server may or may not calculate checksums to verify the data on receipt. On a fetch, the DAOS Server will send a known good checksum with the requested data to the DAOS Client, which will calculate checksums on the data received and verify. Keys and Value Objects \u00b6 Because DAOS is a key/value store, the data for both keys and values will be protected, however, the approach for both is slightly different. For the two different value types, single and array, the approach is also slightly different. Keys \u00b6 On an update and fetch, the client will calculate a checksum for the data used as the distribution and attribute keys and will send it to the server within the RPC. The server verifies the keys with the checksum. While enumerating keys, the server will calculate checksums for the keys and pack within the RPC message to the client. The client will verify the keys received. Note Checksums for keys are not stored on the server. A hash of the key is calculated and used to index the key in the server tree of the keys (see VOS Key Array Stores ). It is also expected that keys are stored only in Storage Class Memory which has reliable data integrity protection. Values \u00b6 On an update, the client will calculate a checksum for the data of the value and will send it to the server within the RPC. If \"server verify\" is enabled, the server will calculate a new checksum for the value and compare with the checksum received from the client to verify the integrity of the value. If the checksums don't match, then data corruption has occurred and an error is returned to the client indicating that the client should try the update again. Whether \"server verify\" is enabled or not, the server will store the checksum. See VOS for more info about checksum management and storage in VOS. On a fetch, the server will return the stored checksum to the client with the values fetched so the client can verify the values received. If the checksums don't match, then the client will fetch from another replica if available in an attempt to get uncorrupted data. There are some slight variations to this approach for the two different types of values. (See Storage Model for more details about the single value and array value types) Single Value \u00b6 A Single Value is an atomic value, meaning that writes to a single value will update the entire value and reads retrieve the entire value. Other DAOS features such as Erasure Codes might split a Single Value into multiple shards to be distributed among multiple storage nodes. Either the whole Single Value (if going to a single node) or each shard (if distributed) will have a checksum calculated, sent to the server, and stored on the server. Note that it is possible for a single value, or shard of a single value, to be smaller than the checksum derived from it. It is advised that if an application needs many small single values to use an Array Type instead. Array Values \u00b6 Unlike Single Values, Array Values can be updated and fetched at any part of an array. In addition, updates to an array are versioned, so a fetch can include parts from multiple versions of the array. Each of these versioned parts of an array are called extents. The following diagrams illustrate a couple examples (also see VOS Key Array Stores for more information): A single extent update (blue line) from index 2-13.

Each target is thus effectively a single point of failure. DAOS achieves availability and durability of both data and metadata by providing redundancy across targets in different fault domains. DAOS internal pool and container metadata are replicated via a robust consensus algorithm. DAOS objects are then safely replicated or erasure-coded by transparently leveraging the DAOS distributed transaction mechanisms internally. The purpose of this section is to provide details on how DAOS achieves fault tolerance and guarantees object resilience. Hierarchical Fault Domains \u00b6 A fault domain is a set of servers sharing the same point of failure and which are thus likely to fail altogether. DAOS assumes that fault domains are hierarchical and do not overlap. The actual hierarchy and fault domain membership must be supplied by an external database used by DAOS to generate the pool map. Pool metadata are replicated on several nodes from different high-level fault domains for high availability, whereas object data is replicated or erasure-coded over a variable number of fault domains depending on the selected object class. Fault Detection \u00b6 DAOS servers are monitored within a DAOS system through a gossip-based protocol called SWIM that provides accurate, efficient, and scalable server fault detection. Storage attached to each DAOS target is monitored through periodic local health assessment. Whenever a local storage I/O error is returned to the DAOS server, an internal health check procedure will be called automatically. This procedure will make an overall health assessment by analyzing the IO error code and device SMART/Health data. If the result is negative, the target will be marked as faulty, and further I/Os to this target will be rejected and re-routed. Fault Isolation \u00b6 Once detected, the faulty target or servers (effectivelly a set of targets) must be excluded from the pool map. This process is triggered either manually by the administrator or automatically. Upon exclusion, the new version of the pool map is eagerly pushed to all storage targets. At this point, the pool enters a degraded mode that might require extra processing on access (e.g. reconstructing data out of erasure code). Consequently, DAOS client and storage nodes retry RPC indefinitely until they find an alternative replacement target from the new pool map. At this point, all outstanding communications with the evicted target are aborted, and no further messages should be sent to the target until it is explicitly reintegrated (possibly only after maintenance action). All storage targets are promptly notified of pool map changes by the pool service. This is not the case for client nodes, which are lazily informed of pool map invalidation each time they communicate with servers. To do so, clients pack in every RPC their current pool map version. Servers reply not only with the current pool map version. Consequently, when a DAOS client experiences RPC timeout, it regularly communicates with the other DAOS target to guarantee that its pool map is always current. Clients will then eventually be informed of the target exclusion and enter into degraded mode. This mechanism guarantees global node eviction and that all nodes eventually share the same view of target aliveness. Fault Recovery \u00b6 Upon exclusion from the pool map, each target starts the rebuild process automatically to restore data redundancy. First, each target creates a list of local objects impacted by the target exclusion. This is done by scanning a local object table maintained by the underlying storage layer. Then for each impacted object, the location of the new object shard is determined and redundancy of the object restored for the whole history (i.e., snapshots). Once all impacted objects have been rebuilt, the pool map is updated a second time to report the target as failed out. This marks the end of collective rebuild process and the exit from degraded mode for this particular fault.

A DAOS pool is a storage reservation distributed across a collection of targets. The actual space allocated to the pool on each target is called a pool shard. The total space allocated to a pool is decided at creation time and can be expanded over time by resizing all the pool shards (within the limit of the storage capacity dedicated to each target) or by spanning more targets (i.e., adding more pool shards). A pool offers storage virtualization and is the unit of provisioning and isolation. DAOS pools cannot span across multiple systems. A pool can host multiple transactional object store called DAOS containers. Each container is a private object address space, which can be modified transactionally and independently of the other containers stored in the same pool. A container is the unit of snapshot and data management. DAOS objects belonging to a container can be distributed across any target of the pool for both performance and resilience and can be accessed through different APIs to represent structured, semi-structured and unstructured data efficiently The table below shows the targeted level of scalability for each DAOS concept. DAOS Concept Order of Magnitude System 10 5 Servers (hundreds of thousands) and 10 2 Pools (hundreds) Server 10 1 Targets (tens) Pool 10 2 Containers (hundreds) Container 10 9 Objects (billions) DAOS Pool \u00b6 A pool is identified by a unique UUID and maintains target memberships in a persistent versioned list called the pool map. The membership is definitive and consistent, and membership changes are sequentially numbered. The pool map not only records the list of active targets, it also contains the storage topology under the form of a tree that is used to identify targets sharing common hardware components. For instance, the first level of the tree can represent targets sharing the same motherboard, and then the second level can represent all motherboards sharing the same rack and finally the third level can represent all racks in the same cage. This framework effectively represents hierarchical fault domains, which are then used to avoid placing redundant data on targets subject to correlated failures. At any point in time, new targets can be added to the pool map, and failed ones can be excluded. Moreover, the pool map is fully versioned, which effectively assigns a unique sequence to each modification of the map, more particularly for failed node removal. A pool shard is a reservation of persistent memory optionally combined with a pre-allocated space on NVMe storage on a specific target. It has a fixed capacity and fails operations when full. Current space usage can be queried at any time and reports the total amount of bytes used by any data type stored in the pool shard. Upon target failure and exclusion from the pool map, data redundancy inside the pool is automatically restored online. This self-healing process is known as rebuild. Rebuild progress is recorded regularly in special logs in the pool stored in persistent memory to address cascading failures. When new targets are added, data is automatically migrated to the newly added targets to redistribute space usage equally among all the members. This process is known as space rebalancing and uses dedicated persistent logs as well to support interruption and restart. A pool is a set of targets spread across different storage nodes over which data and metadata are distributed to achieve horizontal scalability, and replicated or erasure-coded to ensure durability and availability. When creating a pool, a set of system properties must be defined to configure the different features supported by the pool. Also, user can define their attributes that will be stored persistently. A pool is only accessible to authenticated and authorized applications. Multiple security frameworks could be supported, from NFSv4 access control lists to third party-based authentication (such as Kerberos). Security is enforced when connecting to the pool. Upon successful connection to the pool, a connection context is returned to the application process. As detailed previously, a pool stores many different sorts of persistent metadata, such as the pool map, authentication, and authorization information, user attributes, properties and rebuild logs. Such metadata are critical and require the highest level of resiliency. Therefore, the pool metadata are replicated on a few nodes from distinct high-level fault domains. For very large configurations with hundreds of thousands of storage nodes, only a very small fraction of those nodes (in the order of tens) run the pool metadata service. With a limited number of storage nodes, DAOS can afford to rely on a consensus algorithm to reach agreement and to guarantee consistency in the presence of faults and to avoid split-brain syndrome. To access a pool, a user process should connect to this pool and pass the security checks. Once granted, a pool connection can be shared (via local2global() and global2local() operations) with any or all of its peer application processes (similar to the openg() POSIX extension). This collective connect mechanism allows avoiding metadata request storm when a massively distributed job is run on the datacenter. A pool connection is then revoked when the original process that issued the connection request disconnects from the pool. DAOS Container \u00b6 A container represents an object address space inside a pool and is identified by a UUID. The diagram below represents how the user (i.e., I/O middleware, domain-specific data format, big data or AI frameworks ...) could use the container concept to store related datasets. Like pools, containers can store user attributes, and a set of properties must be passed at container creation time to configure different features like checksums. To access a container, an application must first connect to the pool and then open the container. If the application is authorized to access the container, a container handle is returned. This includes capabilities that authorize any process in the application to access the container and its contents. The opening process may share this handle with any or all of its peers. Their capabilities are revoked either on container close. Objects in a container may have different schemas for data distribution and redundancy over targets. Dynamic or static striping, replication, or erasure code are some parameters required to define the object schema. The object class defines common schema attributes for a set of objects. Each object class is assigned a unique identifier and is associated with a given schema at the pool level. A new object class can be defined at any time with a configurable schema, which is then immutable after creation, or at least until all objects belonging to the class have been destroyed. For convenience, several object classes expected to be the most commonly used will be predefined by default when the pool is created, as shown the table below table below. Sample of Pre-defined Object Classes Object Class (RW = read/write, RM = read-mostly Redundancy Layout (SC = stripe count, RC = replica count, PC = parity count, TGT = target Small size & RW Replication static SCxRC, e.g. 1x4 Small size & RM Erasure code static SC+PC, e.g. 4+2 Large size & RW Replication static SCxRC over max #targets) Large size & RM Erasure code static SCx(SC+PC) w/ max #TGT) Unknown size & RW Replication SCxRC, e.g. 1x4 initially and grows Unknown size & RM Erasure code SC+PC, e.g. 4+2 initially and grows As shown below, each object is identified in the container by a unique 128-bit object address. The high 32 bits of the object address is reserved for DAOS to encode internal metadata such as the object class. The remaining 96 bits are managed by the user and should be unique inside the container. Those bits can be used by upper layers of the stack to encode their metadata as long as unicity is guaranteed. A per-container 64-bit scalable object ID allocator is provided in the DAOS API. The object ID to be stored by the application is the full 128-bit address which is for single use only and can be associated with only a single object schema. DAOS Object ID Structure <---------------------------------- 128 bits ----------------------------------> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |DAOS Internal Bits| Unique User Bits | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <---- 32 bits ----><------------------------- 96 bits -------------------------> A container is the basic unit of transaction and versioning. All object operations are implicitly tagged by the DAOS library with a timestamp called an epoch. The DAOS transaction API allows combining multiple object updates into a single atomic transaction with multi-version concurrency control based on epoch ordering. All the versioned updates may periodically be aggregated to reclaim space utilized by overlapping writes and to reduce metadata complexity. A snapshot is a permanent reference that can be placed on a specific epoch to prevent aggregation. Container metadata (i.e., list of snapshots, container open handles, object class, user attributes, properties, and others) are stored in persistent memory and maintained by a dedicated container metadata service that either uses the same replicated engine as the parent metadata pool service or has its own engine. This is configurable when creating a container. Like a pool, access to a container is controlled by the container handle. To acquire a valid handle, an application process must open the container and pass the security checks. This container handle may then be shared with other peer application processes via the container local2global() and global2local() operations. DAOS Object \u00b6 To avoid scaling problems and overhead common to a traditional storage system, DAOS objects are intentionally simple. No default object metadata beyond the type and schema are provided. This means that the system does not maintain time, size, owner, permissions or even track openers. To achieve high availability and horizontal scalability, many object schemas (replication/erasure code, static/dynamic striping, and others) are provided. The schema framework is flexible and easily expandable to allow for new custom schema types in the future. The layout is generated algorithmically on object open from the object identifier and the pool map. End-to-end integrity is assured by protecting object data with checksums during network transfer and storage. A DAOS object can be accessed through different APIs: Multi-level key-array API is the native object interface with locality feature. The key is split into a distribution (i.e., dkey) and an attribute (i.e., akey) key. Both the dkey and akey can be of variable length and type (i.e. a string, an integer or even a complex data structure). All entries under the same dkey are guaranteed to be collocated on the same target. The value associated with akey can be either a single variable-length value that cannot be partially overwritten or an array of fixed-length values. Both the akeys and dkeys support enumeration. Key-value API provides a simple key and variable-length value interface. It supports the traditional put, get, remove and list operations. Array API implements a one-dimensional array of fixed-size elements addressed by a 64-bit offset. A DAOS array supports arbitrary extent read, write and punch operations.","title":"Storage Model"},{"location":"overview/storage/#storage-model","text":"The figure below represents the fundamental abstractions of the DAOS storage model.

The membership is definitive and consistent, and membership changes are sequentially numbered. The pool map not only records the list of active targets, it also contains the storage topology under the form of a tree that is used to identify targets sharing common hardware components. For instance, the first level of the tree can represent targets sharing the same motherboard, and then the second level can represent all motherboards sharing the same rack and finally the third level can represent all racks in the same cage. This framework effectively represents hierarchical fault domains, which are then used to avoid placing redundant data on targets subject to correlated failures. At any point in time, new targets can be added to the pool map, and failed ones can be excluded. Moreover, the pool map is fully versioned, which effectively assigns a unique sequence to each modification of the map, more particularly for failed node removal. A pool shard is a reservation of persistent memory optionally combined with a pre-allocated space on NVMe storage on a specific target. It has a fixed capacity and fails operations when full. Current space usage can be queried at any time and reports the total amount of bytes used by any data type stored in the pool shard. Upon target failure and exclusion from the pool map, data redundancy inside the pool is automatically restored online. This self-healing process is known as rebuild. Rebuild progress is recorded regularly in special logs in the pool stored in persistent memory to address cascading failures. When new targets are added, data is automatically migrated to the newly added targets to redistribute space usage equally among all the members. This process is known as space rebalancing and uses dedicated persistent logs as well to support interruption and restart. A pool is a set of targets spread across different storage nodes over which data and metadata are distributed to achieve horizontal scalability, and replicated or erasure-coded to ensure durability and availability. When creating a pool, a set of system properties must be defined to configure the different features supported by the pool. Also, user can define their attributes that will be stored persistently. A pool is only accessible to authenticated and authorized applications. Multiple security frameworks could be supported, from NFSv4 access control lists to third party-based authentication (such as Kerberos). Security is enforced when connecting to the pool. Upon successful connection to the pool, a connection context is returned to the application process. As detailed previously, a pool stores many different sorts of persistent metadata, such as the pool map, authentication, and authorization information, user attributes, properties and rebuild logs. Such metadata are critical and require the highest level of resiliency. Therefore, the pool metadata are replicated on a few nodes from distinct high-level fault domains. For very large configurations with hundreds of thousands of storage nodes, only a very small fraction of those nodes (in the order of tens) run the pool metadata service. With a limited number of storage nodes, DAOS can afford to rely on a consensus algorithm to reach agreement and to guarantee consistency in the presence of faults and to avoid split-brain syndrome. To access a pool, a user process should connect to this pool and pass the security checks. Once granted, a pool connection can be shared (via local2global() and global2local() operations) with any or all of its peer application processes (similar to the openg() POSIX extension). This collective connect mechanism allows avoiding metadata request storm when a massively distributed job is run on the datacenter. A pool connection is then revoked when the original process that issued the connection request disconnects from the pool.","title":"DAOS Pool"},{"location":"overview/storage/#daos-container","text":"A container represents an object address space inside a pool and is identified by a UUID. The diagram below represents how the user (i.e., I/O middleware, domain-specific data format, big data or AI frameworks ...) could use the container concept to store related datasets. Like pools, containers can store user attributes, and a set of properties must be passed at container creation time to configure different features like checksums. To access a container, an application must first connect to the pool and then open the container. If the application is authorized to access the container, a container handle is returned. This includes capabilities that authorize any process in the application to access the container and its contents. The opening process may share this handle with any or all of its peers. Their capabilities are revoked either on container close. Objects in a container may have different schemas for data distribution and redundancy over targets. Dynamic or static striping, replication, or erasure code are some parameters required to define the object schema. The object class defines common schema attributes for a set of objects. Each object class is assigned a unique identifier and is associated with a given schema at the pool level. A new object class can be defined at any time with a configurable schema, which is then immutable after creation, or at least until all objects belonging to the class have been destroyed. For convenience, several object classes expected to be the most commonly used will be predefined by default when the pool is created, as shown the table below table below. Sample of Pre-defined Object Classes Object Class (RW = read/write, RM = read-mostly Redundancy Layout (SC = stripe count, RC = replica count, PC = parity count, TGT = target Small size & RW Replication static SCxRC, e.g. 1x4 Small size & RM Erasure code static SC+PC, e.g. 4+2 Large size & RW Replication static SCxRC over max #targets) Large size & RM Erasure code static SCx(SC+PC) w/ max #TGT) Unknown size & RW Replication SCxRC, e.g. 1x4 initially and grows Unknown size & RM Erasure code SC+PC, e.g. 4+2 initially and grows As shown below, each object is identified in the container by a unique 128-bit object address. The high 32 bits of the object address is reserved for DAOS to encode internal metadata such as the object class. The remaining 96 bits are managed by the user and should be unique inside the container. Those bits can be used by upper layers of the stack to encode their metadata as long as unicity is guaranteed. A per-container 64-bit scalable object ID allocator is provided in the DAOS API. The object ID to be stored by the application is the full 128-bit address which is for single use only and can be associated with only a single object schema. DAOS Object ID Structure <---------------------------------- 128 bits ----------------------------------> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |DAOS Internal Bits| Unique User Bits | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <---- 32 bits ----><------------------------- 96 bits -------------------------> A container is the basic unit of transaction and versioning. All object operations are implicitly tagged by the DAOS library with a timestamp called an epoch. The DAOS transaction API allows combining multiple object updates into a single atomic transaction with multi-version concurrency control based on epoch ordering. All the versioned updates may periodically be aggregated to reclaim space utilized by overlapping writes and to reduce metadata complexity. A snapshot is a permanent reference that can be placed on a specific epoch to prevent aggregation. Container metadata (i.e., list of snapshots, container open handles, object class, user attributes, properties, and others) are stored in persistent memory and maintained by a dedicated container metadata service that either uses the same replicated engine as the parent metadata pool service or has its own engine. This is configurable when creating a container. Like a pool, access to a container is controlled by the container handle. To acquire a valid handle, an application process must open the container and pass the security checks. This container handle may then be shared with other peer application processes via the container local2global() and global2local() operations.","title":"DAOS Container"},{"location":"overview/storage/#daos-object","text":"To avoid scaling problems and overhead common to a traditional storage system, DAOS objects are intentionally simple. No default object metadata beyond the type and schema are provided. This means that the system does not maintain time, size, owner, permissions or even track openers. To achieve high availability and horizontal scalability, many object schemas (replication/erasure code, static/dynamic striping, and others) are provided. The schema framework is flexible and easily expandable to allow for new custom schema types in the future. The layout is generated algorithmically on object open from the object identifier and the pool map. End-to-end integrity is assured by protecting object data with checksums during network transfer and storage. A DAOS object can be accessed through different APIs: Multi-level key-array API is the native object interface with locality feature. The key is split into a distribution (i.e., dkey) and an attribute (i.e., akey) key. Both the dkey and akey can be of variable length and type (i.e. a string, an integer or even a complex data structure). All entries under the same dkey are guaranteed to be collocated on the same target. The value associated with akey can be either a single variable-length value that cannot be partially overwritten or an array of fixed-length values. Both the akeys and dkeys support enumeration. Key-value API provides a simple key and variable-length value interface. It supports the traditional put, get, remove and list operations. Array API implements a one-dimensional array of fixed-size elements addressed by a 64-bit offset. A DAOS array supports arbitrary extent read, write and punch operations.","title":"DAOS Object"},{"location":"overview/terminology/","text":"Terminology \u00b6 Acronym Expansion ABT Argobots ACLs Access Control Lists BIO Blob I/O CART Collective and RPC Transport CGO Go tools that enable creation of Go packages that call C code CN Compute Node COTS Commercial off-the-shelf CPU Central Processing Unit Daemon A process offering system-level resources.

Distributed consistency is provided via a lockless optimistic concurrency control mechanism based on multi-version timestamp ordering. DAOS transactions are serializable and can be used on an ad-hoc basis for parts of the datasets that need it. The DAOS versioning mechanism allows creating persistent container snapshots which provide point-in-time distributed consistent views of a container which can be used to build producer-consumer pipeline. Epoch and Timestamp Ordering \u00b6 Each DAOS I/O operation is tagged with a timestamp called epoch. An epoch is a 64-bit integer that integrates both logical and physical clocks (see HLC paper ). The DAOS API provides helper functions to convert an epoch to traditional POSIX time (i.e., struct timespec, see clock_gettime(3)). Container Snapshot \u00b6 As shown in the figure below, the content of a container can be snapshot at any time. DAOS snapshots are very lightweight and are tagged with the epoch associated with the time when the snapshot was created. Once successfully created, a snapshot remains readable until it is explicitly destroyed. The content of a container can be rolled back to a particular snapshot. The container snapshot feature allows supporting native producer/consumer pipeline as represented in the diagram below. The producer will generate a snapshot once a consistent version of the dataset has been successfully written. The consumer applications may subscribe to container snapshot events so that new updates can be processed as the producer commits them. The immutability of the snapshots guarantees that the consumer sees consistent data, even while the producer continues with new updates. Both the producer and consumer indeed operate on different versions of the container and do not need any serialization. Once the producer generates a new version of the dataset, the consumer may query the differences between the two snapshots and process only the incremental changes. Distributed Transactions \u00b6 Unlike POSIX, the DAOS API does not impose any worst-case concurrency control mechanism to address conflicting I/O operations. Instead, individual I/O operations are tagged with a different epoch and applied in epoch order, regardless of execution order. This baseline model delivers the maximum scalability and performance to data models and applications that do not generate conflicting I/O workload. Typical examples are collective MPI-IO operations, POSIX file read/write or HDF5 dataset read/write. For parts of the data model that require conflict serialization, DAOS provides distributed serializable transaction based on multi-version concurrency control. Transactions are typically needed when different user process can overwrite the value associated with a dkey/akey pair. Examples are a SQL database over DAOS or a consistent POSIX namespace accessed concurrently by uncoordinated clients.

The DAOS transaction mechanism automatically detects the traditional read/write, write/read and write/write conflicts and aborts one of the conflicting transactions that have to be restarted by the user (i.e., transaction fails to commit with -DER_RESTART).

This document contains the following sections: Storage Management and Workflow Integration Workflow Execution Bulk Synchronous Checkpoint Producer/Consumer Concurrent Producers Storage Node Failure and Resilvering Storage Management & Workflow Integration \u00b6 In this section, we consider two different cluster configurations: Cluster A: All or a majority of the compute nodes have local persistent memory. In other words, each compute node is also a storage node. Cluster B: Storage nodes are dedicated to storage and disseminated across the fabric. They are not used for computation and thus do not run any application code. At boot time, each storage node starts the DAOS server that instantiates service threads. In cluster A, the DAOS threads are bound to the noisy cores and interact with the FWK if mOS is used. In cluster B, the DAOS server can use all the cores of the storage node. The DAOS server then loads the storage management module. This module scans for local storage on the node and reports the result to a designated master DAOS server that aggregates information about the used and available storage across the cluster. The management module also retrieves the fault domain hierarchy (from a database or specific service) and integrates this with the storage information. The resource manager then uses the DAOS management API to query available storage and allocate a certain amount of storage (i.e. persistent memory) for a new workflow that is to be scheduled. In cluster A, this allocation request may list the compute nodes where the workflow is supposed to run, whereas in case B, it may ask for storage nearby some allocated compute nodes. Once successfully allocated, the master server will initialize a DAOS pool covering the allocated storage by formatting the VOS layout (i.e. fallocate(1) a PMEM file & create VOS super block) and starting the pool service which will initiate the Raft engine in charge of the pool membership and metadata. At this point, the DAOS pool is ready to be handed off to the actual workflow. When the workflow starts, one rank connects to the DAOS pool, then uses local2global() to generate a global connection handle and shares it with all the other application ranks that use global2local() to create a local connection handle. At that point, new containers can be created and existing ones opened collectively or individually by the application tasks. Workflow Execution \u00b6 We consider the workflow represented in the figure below. Each green box represents a different container. All containers are stored in the same DAOS pool represented by the grey box. The simulation reads data from the input container and writes raw timesteps to another container. It also regularly dumps checkpoints to a dedicated ckpt container. The down-sample job reads the raw timesteps and generates sampled timesteps to be analyzed by the post-process which stores analysis data into yet another container. Bulk Synchronous Checkpoint \u00b6 Defensive I/O is used to manage a large simulation run over a period of time larger than the platform's mean time between failure (MTBF). The simulation regularly dumps the current computation state to a dedicated container used to guarantee forward progress in the event of failures. This section elaborates on how checkponting could be implemented on top of the DAOS storage stack. We first consider the traditional approach relying on blocking barriers and then a more loosely coupled execution. Blocking Barrier When the simulation job starts, one task opens the checkpoint container and fetches the current global HCE. It thens obtains an epoch hold and shares the data (the container handle, the current LHE and global HCE) with peer tasks. Each task checks for the latest computation state saved to the checkpoint container by reading with an epoch equal to the global HCE and resumes computation from where it was last checkpointed. To checkpoint, each task executes a barrier to synchronize with the other tasks, writes its current computation state to the checkpoint container at epoch LHE, flushes all updates and finally executes another barrier. Once all tasks have completed the last barrier, one designated task (e.g. rank 0) commits the LHE which is then increased by one on successful commit. This process is repeated regularly until the simulation successfully completes. Non-blocking Barrier We now consider another approach to checkpointing where the execution is more loosely coupled. As in the previous case, one task is responsible for opening the checkpoint container, fetching the global HCE, obtaining an epoch hold and sharing the data with the other peer tasks. However, tasks can now checkpoint their computation state at their own pace without waiting for each other. After the computation of N timesteps, each task dumps its state to the checkpoint container at epoch LHE+1, flushes the changes and calls a non-blocking barrier (e.g. MPI_Ibarrier()) once done. Then after another N timesteps, the new checkpoint is written with epoch LHE+2 and so on. For each checkpoint, the epoch number is incremented. Moreover, each task regularly calls MPI_Test() to check for barrier completion which allows them to recycle the MPI_Request. Upon barrier completion, one designated task (typically rank 0) also commits the associated epoch number. All epochs are guaranteed to be committed in sequence and each committed epoch is a new consistent checkpoint to restart from. On failure, checkpointed states that have been written by individual tasks, but not committed, are automatically rolled back. Producer/Consumer \u00b6 In the previous figure , we have two examples of producer/consumer. The down-sample job consumes raw timesteps generated by the simulation job and produces sampled timesteps analysed by the post-process job. The DAOS stack provides specific mechanims for producer/consumer workflow which even allows the consumer to dumps the result of its analysis into the same container as the producer. Private Container The down-sample job opens the sampled timesteps container, fetchs the current global HCE, obtains an epoch hold and writes new sampled data to this container at epoch LHE. While this is occurring, the post process job opens the container storing analyzed data for write, checks for the latest analyzed timesteps and obtains an epoch hold on this container. It then opens the sampled timesteps container for read, and checks whether the next time-step to be consumed is ready. If not, it waits for a new global HCE to be committed (notified by asynchronous event completion on the event queue) and checks again. When the requested time-step is available, the down-sample job processes input data for this new time-step, dumps the results in its own container and updates the latest analyzed time-step in its metadata. It then commits updates to its output container and waits again for a new epoch to be committed and repeats the same process. Another approach is for the producer job to create explicit snapshots for epochs of interest and have the analysis job waiting and processing snapshots. This avoid processing every single committed epoch. Shared Container We now assume that the container storing the sampled timesteps and the one storing the analyzed data are a single container. In other words, the down-sample job consumes input data and writes output data to the same container. The down-sample job opens the shared container, obtains an hold and dumps new sampled timesteps to the container. As before, the post-process job also opens the container, fetches the latest analyzed timestep, but does not obtain an epoch hold until a new global HCE is ready. Once the post-process job is notified of a new global HCE, it can analyze the new sampled timesteps, obtain an hold and write its analysed data to the same container. Once this is done, the post-process job flushes its updates, commits the held epoch and releases the held epoch. At that point, it can wait again for a new global HCE to be generated by the down-sample job. Concurrent Producers \u00b6 In the previous section, we consider a producer and a consumer job concurrently reading and writing into the same container, but in disjoint objects. We now consider a workflow composed of concurrent producer jobs modifying the same container in a conflicting and uncoordinated manner. This effectively means that the two producers can update the same key of the same KV object or document store or overlapping extents of the same byte array. This model requires the implementation of a concurrency-control mechanism (not part of DAOS) to coordinate conflicting accesses. This section presents an example of such a mechanism based on locking, but alternative approaches can also be considered. A workflow is composed of two applications using a distributed lock manager to serialize contended accesses to DAOS objects. Each application individually opens the same container and grabs an epoch hold whenever it wants to modify some objects in the container. Prior to modifying an object, an application should acquire a write lock on the object. This lock carries a lock value block (LVB) storing the last epoch number in which this object was last modified and committed. Once the lock is acquired, the writer must: read from an epoch equal to the greatest of the epoch specified in the LVB and the handle LRE. submit new writes with an epoch higher than the one in the LVB and the currently held epoch. After all the I/O operations have been completed, flushed, and committed by the application, the LVB is updated with the committed epoch in which the object was modified, and the lock can finally be released. Storage Node Failure and Resilvering \u00b6 In this section, we consider a workflow connected to a DAOS pool and one storage node that suddenly fails. Both DAOS clients and servers communicating with the failed server experience RPC timeouts and inform the RAS system. Failing RPCs are resent repeatedly until the RAS system or the pool metadata service itself decides to declare the storage node dead and evicts it from the pool map. The pool map update, along with the new version, is propagated to all the storage nodes that lazily (in RPC replies) inform clients that a new pool map version is available. Both clients and servers are thus eventually informed of the failure and enter into recovery mode. Server nodes will cooperate to restore redundancy on different servers for the impacted objects, whereas clients will enter in degraded mode and read from other replicas, or reconstruct data from erasure code. This rebuild process is executed online while the container is still being accessed and modified. Once redundancy has been restored for all objects, the poolmap is updated again to inform everyone that the system has recovered from the fault and the system can exit from degraded mode.","title":"Use Cases"},{"location":"overview/use_cases/#use-cases","text":"This section provides a non-exhaustive list of use cases presenting how the DAOS storage model and stack could be used on a real HPC cluster.

We first consider the traditional approach relying on blocking barriers and then a more loosely coupled execution. Blocking Barrier When the simulation job starts, one task opens the checkpoint container and fetches the current global HCE. It thens obtains an epoch hold and shares the data (the container handle, the current LHE and global HCE) with peer tasks. Each task checks for the latest computation state saved to the checkpoint container by reading with an epoch equal to the global HCE and resumes computation from where it was last checkpointed. To checkpoint, each task executes a barrier to synchronize with the other tasks, writes its current computation state to the checkpoint container at epoch LHE, flushes all updates and finally executes another barrier. Once all tasks have completed the last barrier, one designated task (e.g. rank 0) commits the LHE which is then increased by one on successful commit. This process is repeated regularly until the simulation successfully completes. Non-blocking Barrier We now consider another approach to checkpointing where the execution is more loosely coupled. As in the previous case, one task is responsible for opening the checkpoint container, fetching the global HCE, obtaining an epoch hold and sharing the data with the other peer tasks. However, tasks can now checkpoint their computation state at their own pace without waiting for each other. After the computation of N timesteps, each task dumps its state to the checkpoint container at epoch LHE+1, flushes the changes and calls a non-blocking barrier (e.g. MPI_Ibarrier()) once done. Then after another N timesteps, the new checkpoint is written with epoch LHE+2 and so on. For each checkpoint, the epoch number is incremented. Moreover, each task regularly calls MPI_Test() to check for barrier completion which allows them to recycle the MPI_Request. Upon barrier completion, one designated task (typically rank 0) also commits the associated epoch number. All epochs are guaranteed to be committed in sequence and each committed epoch is a new consistent checkpoint to restart from. On failure, checkpointed states that have been written by individual tasks, but not committed, are automatically rolled back.","title":"Bulk Synchronous Checkpoint"},{"location":"overview/use_cases/#producerconsumer","text":"In the previous figure , we have two examples of producer/consumer. The down-sample job consumes raw timesteps generated by the simulation job and produces sampled timesteps analysed by the post-process job. The DAOS stack provides specific mechanims for producer/consumer workflow which even allows the consumer to dumps the result of its analysis into the same container as the producer. Private Container The down-sample job opens the sampled timesteps container, fetchs the current global HCE, obtains an epoch hold and writes new sampled data to this container at epoch LHE. While this is occurring, the post process job opens the container storing analyzed data for write, checks for the latest analyzed timesteps and obtains an epoch hold on this container. It then opens the sampled timesteps container for read, and checks whether the next time-step to be consumed is ready. If not, it waits for a new global HCE to be committed (notified by asynchronous event completion on the event queue) and checks again. When the requested time-step is available, the down-sample job processes input data for this new time-step, dumps the results in its own container and updates the latest analyzed time-step in its metadata. It then commits updates to its output container and waits again for a new epoch to be committed and repeats the same process. Another approach is for the producer job to create explicit snapshots for epochs of interest and have the analysis job waiting and processing snapshots. This avoid processing every single committed epoch. Shared Container We now assume that the container storing the sampled timesteps and the one storing the analyzed data are a single container. In other words, the down-sample job consumes input data and writes output data to the same container. The down-sample job opens the shared container, obtains an hold and dumps new sampled timesteps to the container. As before, the post-process job also opens the container, fetches the latest analyzed timestep, but does not obtain an epoch hold until a new global HCE is ready. Once the post-process job is notified of a new global HCE, it can analyze the new sampled timesteps, obtain an hold and write its analysed data to the same container. Once this is done, the post-process job flushes its updates, commits the held epoch and releases the held epoch. At that point, it can wait again for a new global HCE to be generated by the down-sample job.","title":"Producer/Consumer"},{"location":"overview/use_cases/#concurrent-producers","text":"In the previous section, we consider a producer and a consumer job concurrently reading and writing into the same container, but in disjoint objects. We now consider a workflow composed of concurrent producer jobs modifying the same container in a conflicting and uncoordinated manner. This effectively means that the two producers can update the same key of the same KV object or document store or overlapping extents of the same byte array. This model requires the implementation of a concurrency-control mechanism (not part of DAOS) to coordinate conflicting accesses. This section presents an example of such a mechanism based on locking, but alternative approaches can also be considered. A workflow is composed of two applications using a distributed lock manager to serialize contended accesses to DAOS objects. Each application individually opens the same container and grabs an epoch hold whenever it wants to modify some objects in the container. Prior to modifying an object, an application should acquire a write lock on the object. This lock carries a lock value block (LVB) storing the last epoch number in which this object was last modified and committed. Once the lock is acquired, the writer must: read from an epoch equal to the greatest of the epoch specified in the LVB and the handle LRE. submit new writes with an epoch higher than the one in the LVB and the currently held epoch. After all the I/O operations have been completed, flushed, and committed by the application, the LVB is updated with the committed epoch in which the object was modified, and the lock can finally be released.","title":"Concurrent Producers"},{"location":"overview/use_cases/#storage-node-failure-and-resilvering","text":"In this section, we consider a workflow connected to a DAOS pool and one storage node that suddenly fails. Both DAOS clients and servers communicating with the failed server experience RPC timeouts and inform the RAS system. Failing RPCs are resent repeatedly until the RAS system or the pool metadata service itself decides to declare the storage node dead and evicts it from the pool map. The pool map update, along with the new version, is propagated to all the storage nodes that lazily (in RPC replies) inform clients that a new pool map version is available. Both clients and servers are thus eventually informed of the failure and enter into recovery mode. Server nodes will cooperate to restore redundancy on different servers for the impacted objects, whereas clients will enter in degraded mode and read from other replicas, or reconstruct data from erasure code. This rebuild process is executed online while the container is still being accessed and modified. Once redundancy has been restored for all objects, the poolmap is updated again to inform everyone that the system has recovered from the fault and the system can exit from degraded mode.","title":"Storage Node Failure and Resilvering"},{"location":"user/container/","text":"Container Management \u00b6 DAOS containers are the unit of data management for users.

[TODO] Generate Doxygen document and add a link here. Python Bindings \u00b6 A python module called PyDAOS provides the DAOS python to python users. pydaos \u00b6 pydaos provides a native DAOS python interface exported by a C module. It integrates the DAOS key-value store API with python dictionnaries. Only strings are supported for both the key and value for now. Key-value pair can be inserted/looked up once at a time (see put/get) or in bulk (see bput/bget) taking a python dict as an input. The bulk operations are issued in parallel (up to 16 operations in flight) to maximize the operation rate. Key-value pair are deleted via the put/bput operations by setting the value to either None or the empty string. Once deleted, the key won't be reported during iteration. The DAOS KV objects behave like a python dictionary and supports: - 'dkv[key]' which invokes 'dkv.get(key)' - 'dkv[key] = val' which invokes 'dkv.put(key, val)' - 'for key in dkv:' allows to walk through the key space via the support of python iterators - 'if key is in dkv:' allows to test whether a give key is present in the DAOS KV store. - 'len(dkv)' returns the number of key-value pairs - 'bool(dkv)' reports 'False' if there is no key-value pairs in the DAOS KV and 'True' otherwise. Python iterators are supported, which means that \"for key in kvobj:\" will allow you to walk through the key space. For each method, a PyDError exception is raised with proper DAOS error code (in string format) if the operation cannot be completed. Both python 2.7 and 3.x are supported. pydaos.dbm \u00b6 The pydaos.dbm submodule emulates the dbm.gnu interface on top of pydaos. This allows tranparent migration of application built on top of the dbm.gnu module. It also provides an interface to migrate a POSIX dbm file to pydaos key-value store. pydaos.raw \u00b6 The pydaos.raw submodule provides access to DAOS API functionality via Ctypes and was developed with an emphasis on test use cases. While the majority of unit tests are written in C, higher-level tests are written primarily using the Python API. Interfaces are provided for accessing DAOS management and DAOS API functionality from Python. This higher level interface allows a faster turnaround time on implementing test cases for DAOS. Layout \u00b6 The Python API is split into several files based on functionality: The Python object API: daos_api.py . The mapping of C structures to Python classes daos_cref.py High-level abstraction classes exist to manipulate DAOS storage: class DaosPool(object) class DaosContainer(object) class DaosObj(object) class IORequest(object) DaosPool is a Python class representing a DAOS pool. All pool-related functionality is exposed from this class. Operations such as creating/destroying a pool, connecting to a pool, and adding a target to a storage pool are supported. DaosContainer is a Python class representing a DAOS container. As with the DaosPool class, all container-related functionality is exposed here. This class also exposes abstracted wrapper functions for the flow of creating and committing an object to a DAOS container. DaosObj is a Python class representing a DAOS object. Functionality such as creating/deleting objects in a container, 'punching' objects (delete an object from the specified transaction only), and object query. IORequest is a Python class representing a read or write request against a DAOS object. Several classes exist for management purposes as well: class DaosContext(object) class DaosLog class DaosApiError(Exception) DaosContext is a wrapper around the DAOS libraries. It is initialized with the path where DAOS libraries can be found. DaosLog exposes functionality to write messages to the DAOS client log. DaosApiError is a custom exception class raised by the API internally in the event of a failed DAOS action. Most functions exposed in the DAOS C API support both synchronous and asynchronous execution, and the Python API exposes this same functionality. Each API takes an input event. DaosEvent is the Python representation of this event. If the input event is NULL , the call is synchronous. If an event is supplied, the function will return immediately after submitting API requests to the underlying stack and the user can poll and query the event for completion. Ctypes \u00b6 Ctypes is a built-in Python module for interfacing Python with existing libraries written in C/C++. The Python API is built as an object-oriented wrapper around the DAOS libraries utilizing ctypes. Ctypes documentation can be found here https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html The following demonstrates a simplified example of creating a Python wrapper for the C function daos_pool_tgt_exclude_out , with each input parameter to the C function being cast via ctypes. This also demonstrates struct representation via ctypes: // daos_exclude.c #include <stdio.h> int daos_pool_tgt_exclude_out(const uuid_t uuid, const char *grp, const d_rank_list_t *svc, struct d_tgt_list *tgts, daos_event_t *ev); All input parameters must be represented via ctypes. If a struct is required as an input parameter, a corresponding Python class can be created. For struct d_tgt_list : struct d_tgt_list { d_rank_t *tl_ranks; int32_t *tl_tgts; uint32_t tl_nr; }; class DTgtList(ctypes.Structure): _fields_ = [(\"tl_ranks\", ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_uint32)), (\"tl_tgts\", ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_int32)), (\"tl_nr\", ctypes.c_uint32)] The shared object containing daos_pool_tgt_exclude_out can then be imported and the function called directly: # api.py import ctypes import uuid import conversion # utility library to convert C <---> Python UUIDs # init python variables p_uuid = str(uuid.uuid4()) p_tgts = 2 p_ranks = DaosPool.__pylist_to_array([2]) # cast python variables via ctypes as necessary c_uuid = str_to_c_uuid(p_uuid) c_grp = ctypes.create_string_buffer(b\"daos_group_name\") c_svc = ctypes.POINTER(2) # ensure pointers are cast/passed as such c_tgt_list = ctypes.POINTER(DTgtList(p_ranks, p_tgts, 2))) # again, DTgtList must be passed as pointer # load the shared object my_lib = ctypes.CDLL('/full/path/to/daos_exclude.so') # now call it my_lib.daos_pool_tgt_exclude_out(c_uuid, c_grp, c_svc, c_tgt_list, None) Error Handling \u00b6 The API was designed using the EAFP ( E asier to A sk F orgiveness than get P ermission) idiom. A given function will raise a custom exception on error state, DaosApiError . A user of the API is expected to catch and handle this exception as needed: # catch and log try: daos_some_action() except DaosApiError as e: self.d_log.ERROR(\"My DAOS action encountered an error!\") Logging \u00b6 The Python DAOS API exposes functionality to log messages to the DAOS client log. Messages can be logged as INFO , DEBUG , WARN , or ERR log levels. The DAOS log object must be initialized with the environmental context in which to run: from pydaos.raw import DaosLog self.d_log = DaosLog(self.context) self.d_log.INFO(\"FYI\") self.d_log.DEBUG(\"Debugging code\") self.d_log.WARNING(\"Be aware, may be issues\") self.d_log.ERROR(\"Something went very wrong\") Go Bindings \u00b6 API bindings for Go 2 are also available. https://github.com/daos-stack/daos/blob/master/src/client/pydaos/raw/README.md \u21a9 https://godoc.org/github.com/daos-stack/go-daos/pkg/daos \u21a9","title":"Native Programming Interface"},{"location":"user/interface/#native-programming-interface","text":"","title":"Native Programming Interface"},{"location":"user/interface/#building-against-the-daos-library","text":"To build application or I/O middleware against the native DAOS API, include the daos.h header file in your program and link with -Ldaos .

This higher level interface allows a faster turnaround time on implementing test cases for DAOS.","title":"pydaos.raw"},{"location":"user/interface/#layout","text":"The Python API is split into several files based on functionality: The Python object API: daos_api.py . The mapping of C structures to Python classes daos_cref.py High-level abstraction classes exist to manipulate DAOS storage: class DaosPool(object) class DaosContainer(object) class DaosObj(object) class IORequest(object) DaosPool is a Python class representing a DAOS pool. All pool-related functionality is exposed from this class. Operations such as creating/destroying a pool, connecting to a pool, and adding a target to a storage pool are supported. DaosContainer is a Python class representing a DAOS container. As with the DaosPool class, all container-related functionality is exposed here. This class also exposes abstracted wrapper functions for the flow of creating and committing an object to a DAOS container. DaosObj is a Python class representing a DAOS object. Functionality such as creating/deleting objects in a container, 'punching' objects (delete an object from the specified transaction only), and object query. IORequest is a Python class representing a read or write request against a DAOS object. Several classes exist for management purposes as well: class DaosContext(object) class DaosLog class DaosApiError(Exception) DaosContext is a wrapper around the DAOS libraries. It is initialized with the path where DAOS libraries can be found. DaosLog exposes functionality to write messages to the DAOS client log. DaosApiError is a custom exception class raised by the API internally in the event of a failed DAOS action. Most functions exposed in the DAOS C API support both synchronous and asynchronous execution, and the Python API exposes this same functionality. Each API takes an input event. DaosEvent is the Python representation of this event. If the input event is NULL , the call is synchronous. If an event is supplied, the function will return immediately after submitting API requests to the underlying stack and the user can poll and query the event for completion.","title":"Layout"},{"location":"user/interface/#ctypes","text":"Ctypes is a built-in Python module for interfacing Python with existing libraries written in C/C++. The Python API is built as an object-oriented wrapper around the DAOS libraries utilizing ctypes.
